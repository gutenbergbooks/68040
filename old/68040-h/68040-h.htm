<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">PATERNAL DIPLOMACY.</span></p>

<p class="noin">‘<span class="smcap">What</span>!’ roared Mr. Scratchell, scarlet of visage,
‘you are asked to marry a man with fifteen thousand
a year, and you refuse? Did anybody ever hear of
such lunacy?’</p>

<p>Bella sat shivering at the paternal wrath. Mrs.
Scratchell was weeping dumbly. All the younger
Scratchells were ready to lift up their voices in a
chorus of condemnation. Bella’s folly in refusing
Mr. Piper was, in their eyes, a personal injury.</p>

<p>‘You would not ask me to marry a man I cannot
love, would you, father?’ faltered Bella; ‘a man I
can hardly respect.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span></p>

<p>‘You cannot respect fifteen thousand a year?’ cried
Mr. Scratchell. ‘Then, in the name of all that’s reasonable,
what can you respect?’</p>

<p>‘He is so rough-mannered and dictatorial,’ urged
Bella, ‘so stout and puffy. And it is really dreadful
to hear him murder the Queen’s English.’</p>

<p>Mr. Scratchell looked round at his assembled
family with a wrathful glare, as if he were calling
upon them all to behold this ridiculous daughter
of his.</p>

<p>‘That ever I should have bred and reared such
foolishness!’ he exclaimed. ‘What’s that fairy tale
you were reading the little ones, mother, about the
Princess and the seven feather beds? She had seven
feather beds to sleep upon, one atop of the other, and
couldn’t rest because there was a parched pea under
the bottom one. There’s your proud Princess for
you!’ pointing at his tearful daughter. ‘She turns up
her nose at fifteen thousand a year because the owner
of it doesn’t arrange his words according to Lindley
Murray. Why, I never had much opinion of Lindley
Murray myself, and, what’s more, I never could
understand him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span></p>

<p>‘Father, it isn’t a question of bad grammar. If I
loved Mr. Piper, or felt that I could teach myself to
love him, I shouldn’t care how badly he talked. But
I cannot love him.’</p>

<p>‘Who asks you to love him?’ cried Mr. Scratchell,
folding and unfolding his newspaper violently, in a
whirlwind of indignation. ‘Nobody has made mention
of love—not Piper himself, I warrant. He’s too
sensible a man. You are only asked to marry him,
and to do your duty in that state of life to which it
has pleased God to call you. And very grateful you
ought to be for having been called to fifteen thousand
a year. Think what you can do for your brothers
and sisters, and your poor harassed mother! There’s
a privilege for you. And if Piper should take to
buying property hereabouts, and give me the collection
of his rents, there’d be a lift for me.’</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Scratchell feebly, and with numerous
gasps and choking sobs, uplifted her maternal voice,
and made her moan.</p>

<p>‘I should be the last to press any child of mine
to marry against her inclination,’ she said, ‘but I
should like to see one of my daughters a lady. Bella<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
has been a lady in all her little ways from the time
she could run alone, and I am sure she would become
the highest position—yes, even such a station as Mr.
Piper, with his fortune, could give her. If there was
anything better or brighter before her—any chance
of her getting a young good-looking husband able to
support her comfortably—I wouldn’t say marry Mr.
Piper. But I’m sure I can’t see how any girl is to
get well married in Little Yafford, where the young
men——’</p>

<p>‘Haven’t one sixpence to rub against another,’
interrupted Mr. Scratchell, impatiently.</p>

<p>‘And I know what life is for those that have to
study the outlay of every penny, and to keep their
brains always on the rack in order just barely to
pay their way,’ continued Mrs. Scratchell.</p>

<p>Bella gave a deep, despondent sigh. It was
all true that these worldly-minded parents were
saying. She was no romantic girl to believe in
an impossible future. She knew that for women
of the Scratchell breed life was hard and dry,
like the crusts of the stale loaves which she so
often encountered at the family breakfast-table.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
What was there before her if she persisted in
refusing this high fortune that was ready to be
poured into her lap? Another rebellious family
to teach—an unending procession of verbs, and
pianoforte exercises, dreary fantasias, with all the
old familiar airs turned upside down, and twisted
this way and that, and drawn out to uttermost
attenuation, like a string of Indian-rubber. If
nothing else killed her, Bella thought, she must
assuredly die of those hateful fantasias, the ever-lasting
triplets, the scampering arpeggios, stumbling
and halting, like the canter of a lame horse.</p>

<p>Mr. Scratchell heard that long sigh and guessed
its meaning. He checked his loud indignation, all
of a sudden, and had recourse to diplomacy. The
girl’s own sense was beginning to argue against
her foolishness.</p>

<p>‘Well, my dear,’ he said, quite amiably, ‘if
you’ve made up your mind there’s no use in our
saying any more about it. Your mother and I
would have been proud to see you settled in such
a splendid way—the envy of all the neighbourhood—holding
your head as high as the best of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
’em. But let that pass. You’d better look out
for another situation. With so many mouths as
I’ve got to feed, I can’t afford to encourage idleness.
There must be no twiddling of thumbs in this
family. The <i>Yorkshire Times</i> comes out on
Saturday. There’ll be just time for us to get an
advertisement in.’</p>

<p>Bella gave another sigh, an angry one this
time.</p>

<p>‘You’re very sharp with me, father,’ she said.
‘I should have thought you’d have been glad to
have me at home for a little while, with my time
disengaged.’</p>

<p>‘What?’ ejaculated Mr. Scratchell. ‘Haven’t
you had your afternoons for idleness? Your time
disengaged, indeed! Do you think I want a daughter
of mine to be as useless as a chimney ornament,
good for nothing but to look at?’</p>

<p>And then Mr. Scratchell took out a sheet of
paper, dipped his pen in the ink, and wrinkled
his brow in the effort of composition.</p>

<p>‘Governess, residential or otherwise,’ he began,
pronouncing the words aloud as he wrote, ‘competent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
to impart a sound English education, French,
Italian, German, music, drawing and painting, and
fancy needlework. Able to prepare boys for a
public school. Has had the entire charge of a
gentleman’s family. First-rate references.’</p>

<p>‘There,’ exclaimed Mr. Scratchell. ‘That will
cost a lot of money, but I think it is comprehensive.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know about drawing and painting,’
objected Bella, with a weary air. ‘I never had
much taste that way. I learnt a little with Beatrix,
but——’</p>

<p>‘Then you can teach,’ said Mr. Scratchell,
decisively. ‘If you’ve learnt you know all the
technical words and rules, and you’re quite competent
to teach. When your pupil goes wrong you
can tell her how to go right. That’s quite enough.
Nobody expects you to be a Michael Angelo.’</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid I shall look like an impostor if I
attempt to teach drawing,’ remonstrated Bella.</p>

<p>‘Would not object to a school,’ wrote Mr.
Scratchell, adding to the advertisement.</p>

<p>‘But I would very, very, very much object,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
papa,’ cried Bella. ‘I will not go into a school
to please anybody.’</p>

<p>‘My dear, you have got to earn your bread,
and if you can’t earn it in a private family you
must earn it in a school,’ explained her father.
‘I want the advertisement to be comprehensive,
and to bring as many answers as possible. You
are not obliged to take a situation in a school
simply because you get one offered you—but if
your only offer is of that kind you must accept it.
Hobson’s choice, you know.’</p>

<p>Bella began to cry.</p>

<p>‘The little Pipers are very hateful,’ she sobbed,
‘but I dare say strange children would be worse.’</p>

<p>‘If the little Pipers were your step-children
you could do what you liked with them,’ said
Mr. Scratchell.</p>

<p>‘Oh, father,’ remonstrated his wife, ‘she would
be bound to be kind to them.’</p>

<p>‘Of course,’ replied Mr. Scratchell. ‘Within certain
limits. It would be kindness to get them
under strict discipline. She could pack them off
to school, and needn’t have them home for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
holidays unless she liked. Come, I think the
advertisement will do. It will cost three or four
shillings, so it ought to answer. Herbert can
take it with him to-morrow when he goes to his
office.’</p>

<p>‘Father,’ cried Bella, desperately, ‘you needn’t
waste your money upon that advertisement. I
won’t take another situation.’</p>

<p>‘Won’t you?’ cried Mr. Scratchell. ‘Then I’m
afraid you’ll have to go to the workhouse, which
would be rather disgraceful at your age. I won’t
keep you in idleness.’</p>

<p>‘I’d sooner marry Mr. Piper than go on teaching
odious children.’</p>

<p>‘You’ll have to wait till Mr. Piper asks you
again,’ replied her father, delighted at having gained
his point, but too diplomatic to show his satisfaction.
‘You’ve refused him once. He may
not care to humiliate himself by risking a second
refusal. However, the advertisement can stand
over for a day or two, since you’ve come to your
senses.’</p>

<p>Mr. Scratchell went off to his official den presently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
and Mrs. Scratchell came over to Bella and
hugged her.</p>

<p>‘Oh, my darling, it would be the making of us
all,’ she exclaimed.</p>

<p>‘I don’t see what good that would be to me,
mother, if I was miserable,’ Bella responded,
sulkily.</p>

<p>‘But you couldn’t be miserable in such a home
as Yafford Park, and with such a good man as
Mr. Piper. It isn’t as if you had ever cared for
anybody else, dear.’</p>

<p>‘No, of course not,’ said Bella, full of bitterness.
‘That makes a difference.’</p>

<p>‘And think what a lady you would be, and how
high you could hold your head.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I would hold my head high enough,
mother. You may be sure of that. I would have
something out of life. Beatrix Harefield should see
what use I could make of money.’</p>

<p>‘Of course, dear. You have such aristocratic
ideas. You could take the lead in Little Yafford
society.’</p>

<p>Bella gave a scornful shrug. The society in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
Little Yafford was hardly worth leading; but Bella
was of the temper that deems it better to reign in a
village than to serve in Rome. She put on her
bonnet and went to call upon Mrs. Dulcimer. That
lady was in the garden, her complexion protected by
a muslin sun-bonnet, washing the green flies off her
roses. To her sympathetic ear Bella imparted the
story of Mr. Piper’s wooing and the paternal wrath.</p>

<p>‘My dear, I don’t wonder that your father was
angry,’ cried the Vicar’s wife. ‘Why, Mr. Piper is
the very man for you. The idea occurred to me
soon after Mrs. Piper’s death. But I didn’t mention
it, for fear of alarming your delicacy. Such a good
homely creature—an excellent husband to his first
wife—and so wealthy. Why, you would be quite a
little queen. How lucky I was mistaken about
Cyril! What a chance you would have lost if you
had married him!’</p>

<p>Bella shuddered.</p>

<p>‘Yes, it would have been a pity,’ she said.</p>

<p>And then she thought how if Cyril had loved and
married her, she—who was just wise enough to know
herself full of faults—might have grown into a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
woman—how, looking up at that image of perfect
manhood, she might have learned to shape herself
into ideal womanhood. Yes, it would have all been
possible if he had only loved her. His love would
have been a liberal education.</p>

<p>Love had been denied her; but wealth, and all
the advantages wealth could give, might be hers.</p>

<p>‘I really begin to think that I was very foolish
to refuse Mr. Piper,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘My love, excuse me, but you were simply
idiotic. However, he is sure to renew his offer. I
shall call and see those dear children of his to-morrow.
And when he asks you again, you will
give him a kinder answer?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Bella, with a long-drawn sigh, ‘since
everybody thinks it would be best.’</p>

<p>Everybody did not include Beatrix Harefield.
Bella had not consulted—nor did she mean to consult—her
old friend and playfellow. She knew quite
well that Beatrix would have advised her against a
mercenary marriage, and in spite of all her sighs and
hesitations, Bella’s sordid little soul languished for
the possession of Mr. Piper’s wealth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Dulcimer was delighted at the notion of
conducting a new courtship to a triumphant issue.
She put on her best bonnet early in the afternoon,
and went to pay her visit to the Park, feeling that
it behoved her to bring matters to a crisis.</p>

<p>Mr. Piper was at home, seated on a garden chair
on his well-kept lawn, basking in the sunshine, after
a heavy dinner which went by the name of luncheon.
He had a sleek, well-fed look at this stage of his
existence, which did not encourage sentimental ideas:
but Mrs. Dulcimer looked at the big white house
with its Doric portico, the stone vases full of bright
scarlet geraniums, the velvet lawn and gaudy flower-beds,
the belt of fine old timber, the deer-park across the
ha-ha, and thought what a happy woman Bella would
be as the mistress of such a domain. She hardly
gave one thought to poor Mr. Piper. He was only a
something that went with the Park; like a bit of outlying
land, which nobody cares about, tacked on to a
large estate.</p>

<p>‘I hope your dear children are all well and
strong,’ said Mrs. Dulcimer, after she had shaken
hands with Mr. Piper, and they had confided to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
each other their opinions about the weather. ‘I
came on purpose to see them.’</p>

<p>‘You shall see them all presently, mum,’ replied
Mr. Piper. ‘The schoolroom maid is cleaning ’em
up a bit. They’ve been regular Turks all this blessed
morning. They’ve lost their gov’ness.’</p>

<p>‘Why, how is that?’ cried the hypocritical Mrs.
Dulcimer. ‘Bella is so fond of them. She is always
talking of her clever little pupils.’</p>

<p>‘She’s left ’em to shift for themselves, for all her
fondness,’ said Mr. Piper; and then, being of a candid
nature, he freely confided his trouble to the Vicar’s
wife.</p>

<p>He told her that he had asked Bella to marry
him, and she had said no, and upon that they had
parted.</p>

<p>‘It was better for her to go,’ he said. ‘I couldn’t
abear the sight of her about the place under the
circumstances. I should feel like the fox with the
grapes. I should be always hardening my heart
against her.’</p>

<p>‘Dear, dear,’ sighed Mrs. Dulcimer. ‘I’m afraid
you were too sudden. A woman is so sensitive about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
such matters. I dare say you took that poor child
by surprise.’</p>

<p>‘Well, mum, perhaps I may. I’d been thinking
of making her an offer for a long time, but it may
have come on her like a thunderclap.’</p>

<p>‘Of course it did. And, being shy and sensitive,
she naturally said no.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t you think she meant no?’ asked Mr.
Piper, swinging himself suddenly round in his garden
chair, and looking very warm and eager.</p>

<p>‘Indeed, I do not. She was with me yesterday
afternoon, and I thought her looking ill and
unhappy. I felt sure there was something wrong.</p>

<p>‘Now you look here, Mrs. Dulcimer,’ said the
widower. ‘I’m not going to offer myself to that
young woman a second time, for the sake of
getting a second refusal; but if you are sure she
won’t say no I don’t mind giving her another
chance. I’m not a proud man, but I’ve got a
proper respect for myself, and I don’t want to be
humiliated. I shan’t ask her again unless I’m
very sure of my ground.’</p>

<p>‘Come and take tea with us to-morrow evening,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
said Mrs. Dulcimer. ‘I’ll get Bella to come
too, and you’ll be able to judge for yourself.
Bring some of your dear children.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, mum, you’re very kind; but I
think until some of the Turk has been flogged
out of them I’d rather not take them into company.
But I’ll come myself with pleasure, and
if you like to ask Bella Scratchell I’ve no objection
to meet her.’</p>

<p>Mr. Piper’s olive branches now appeared, newly
washed and combed, and in their Sunday clothes.
Thus attired they looked a little more vulgar
than in their every-day garments. They were all
angles and sharp lines, and looked embarrassed by
their finery, which, from the corkscrew curls at
the top of their heads to the tight new shoes upon
their afflicted feet, was more or less calculated to
give them pain.</p>

<p>Naturally Mrs. Dulcimer pretended to be enraptured
with them. She discovered in one an
extraordinary likeness to his papa, in another a
striking—yes, a painfully striking resemblance to
her poor dear mamma. She asked them questions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
about their studies and recreations, and having
completely exhausted herself in less than ten
minutes’ performance of these civilities, she rose to
wish Mr. Piper and his young family good-bye.</p>

<p>‘At seven to-morrow, remember,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘I shall be there, mum,’ answered Mr. Piper.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">MR. PIPER IS ACCEPTED.</span></p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dulcimer’s</span> tea party was a success. Bella
appeared in her prettiest muslin gown—an embroidered
Indian muslin that Beatrix had given
her, with a great deal besides, when she went
into mourning. She wore blue ribbons, and was
bright with all the colour and freshness of her
young beauty. Mr. Piper felt himself very far
gone as he sat opposite her at tea. He hardly
knew what he was eating, though he was a man
who usually considered his meals a serious part of
life, and though Rebecca had surpassed herself in
the preparation of a chicken salad.</p>

<p>The evening was lovely, the sunset a study for
Turner, and after tea Mrs. Dulcimer took Mr.
Piper into the garden to show him her famous
roses. Once there the worthy manufacturer was
trapped. Bella was in faithful attendance upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
Vicar’s wife, and presently Rebecca came, flushed
and breathless, to say that her mistress was wanted;
whereupon, with many apologies, Mrs. Dulcimer
left Mr. Piper and Miss Scratchell together.</p>

<p>‘Bella can show you the rest of the garden,’
she said as she hurried off.</p>

<p>‘Take me down by the gooseberry bushes, Bella,’
said Mr. Piper. ‘It’s shadier and more retired there.’</p>

<p>And in that shady and retired spot, with the
rugged old plum trees and pear trees on the
crumbly red wall looking at them, and the happy
snails taking their evening promenades under the
thorny gooseberry bushes, and the luxuriant scarlet
runners making a curtain between these two lovers
and the outside world, Mr. Piper—in fewest and
plainest words—repeated his offer, and this time
was not refused.</p>

<p>‘Bella,’ he exclaimed, with a little gush of
emotion, putting his betrothed’s small hand under
his elephantine arm, ‘I’ll make you the happiest
woman in the three Ridings. You shall have everything
that heart can wish. Poor Maggie never
could cotton to her position. My good fortune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
came too late for her. She had got into a groove
when I was a struggling man, and in that groove
she stuck. She tried hard to play the lady; but
she couldn’t manage it, poor soul. She was always
the anxious hard-working housewife at bottom.
There’s no rubbing the spots out of the leopard’s
hide, or whitening the Ethiopian, you see, Bella.
Now you were born a lady.’</p>

<p>Bella simpered and blushed.</p>

<p>‘I shall try not to disgrace your fortune,’ she
said, meekly.</p>

<p>‘Disgrace it! Why, you’ll set it off by your
prettiness and your nice little ways. I mean to
get you into county society, Bella. I never tried it
on with Mrs. P., for I felt she wasn’t up to it; but
I shall take you slap in among the county folks.’</p>

<p>Bella shuddered. The little she had seen and
heard of county people led her to believe that they
were very slow to open their doors to such men
as Mr. Piper.</p>

<p>‘Mrs. P. never had but one hoss and a broom,’
said the widower, walking his chosen one briskly
up and down behind the curtain of scarlet runners.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
‘You shall have a pair. I think you was made
for a carriage and pair. Shall it be a landau or a
b’rouche?’</p>

<p>Bella opined, with all modesty, that she would
prefer a barouche.</p>

<p>‘You’re right,’ exclaimed Mr. Piper, ‘a woman
looks more queenly in a barouche. And you can
have poor Mrs. P.’s brougham done up for night
work. And you shall have a chaise and the
prettiest pair of ponies that can be bought for
money, and then you can drive me about on fine
afternoons. I’m getting of an age when a man
likes to take his ease, and there’s nothing nicer
to my fancy than sitting behind a handsome pair
of ponies driven by a pretty woman. Can you
drive?’</p>

<p>‘I dare say I could if I tried,’ answered Bella.</p>

<p>‘Ah, I’ll have you taught. You’ll have a good
deal to learn when you are Mrs. Piper, but you’re
young enough to take kindly to a change in your
circumstances. Poor Moggie wasn’t. Her mind
was always in the bread-pan or the butcher’s
book.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span></p>

<p>In this practical manner were matters settled
between Mr. Piper and his betrothed. The widower
called upon Mr. Scratchell next day, and obtained
that gentleman’s consent to his nuptials. The
consent was granted with a certain air of reluctance
which enhanced the favour.</p>

<p>‘As far as my personal respect for you goes,
there is no man living I’d sooner have for a son-in-law,’
said Mr. Scratchell, ‘but you’ll allow that
there is a great disparity of age between you and
my daughter.’</p>

<p>Mr. Piper was quite willing to allow this.</p>

<p>‘If I couldn’t marry a pretty girl I wouldn’t
marry at all,’ he said. ‘I don’t want a housekeeper.
I want some one bright and pleasant to look at
when I come home to dinner. As for the disparity,
well, I shan’t forget that in the settlement
I mean to make upon Bella.’</p>

<p>This was exactly what Mr. Scratchell wanted.
After this everything was speedily arranged.
Mr. Piper was an impetuous man, and would
brook no delay. He would like to have been
married immediately, but he was persuaded, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
decency’s sake, to wait till October. Even this
would be very soon after the late Mrs. Piper’s
death; but the indulgent Mrs. Dulcimer argued
that a man in Mr. Piper’s forlorn position, with
a young family running to seed in the custody
of servants, might be excused if he hastened
matters.</p>

<p>So Bella set to work to prepare her trousseau
which was by far the most interesting part of the
business, especially after Mr. Piper had slipped a
little bundle of bank-notes into her hand one evening
at parting, which bundle was found to amount to
five hundred pounds. Bella spent long afternoons
shopping at Great Yafford, attended by her mother
and sisters, who all treated her with a new deference,
and were delighted to hang upon her steps and look
on while she made her purchases. She had already
begun to taste the sweets of wealth. Her betrothed
showered gifts upon her, and positively overwhelmed
Mrs. Scratchell with garden stuff and farm produce.
It was a time of plenty which the little Scratchells
had never imagined in their wildest dreams. Mr.
Piper tipped them all round every Sunday afternoon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
His pockets were like the silver mines of Mexico.
He was a man overflowing with new half-crowns
and fat five shilling pieces—noble-looking coins that
seemed to be worth a great deal more than five
meagre shillings.</p>

<p>Beatrix was horrified when she heard of her
friend’s engagement.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Bella, how could you?’ she exclaimed.
‘You are sacrificing yourself for the sake of your
family.’</p>

<p>Bella blushed, for in her heart of hearts she knew
that the interests of her family had been very far
from her thoughts when she consented to become the
second Mrs. Piper.</p>

<p>‘My father and mother had set their hearts upon
it,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘But they had no right to set their hearts upon
your marrying such a man as that.’</p>

<p>‘He is a very good man,’ pleaded Bella.</p>

<p>‘Have you really made up your mind to marry
him? Do you really believe that you can live happily
with him?’ asked Beatrix, earnestly.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ sighed Bella, thinking of the barouche and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
pair, the pony carriage, the huge barrack of a house
at the end of an avenue of elms, the dignity and
importance that all these things would give her.
‘Yes, I have quite made up my mind, Beatrix. It
will be such a good thing for my family—and I
believe I can be happy.’</p>

<p>‘Then I will not say another word against Mr.
Piper. Indeed, I will try my best to like him.’</p>

<p>‘He has a very good heart,’ said Bella, ‘really a
noble heart.’</p>

<p>‘And that is of more consequence than the kind
of English a man talks.’</p>

<p>‘And he is very intelligent,’ said Bella, anxious
to make the best of her bargain. ‘You should hear
him talk of Jeremy Bentham. Papa says it is quite
wonderful.’</p>

<p>‘And what about his children, Bella? Are they
nice? Do you feel that you can love them?’</p>

<p>Bella involuntarily made a wry face.</p>

<p>‘They are not very nice,’ she answered, ‘but it will
be my duty to love them, and of course I shall do so.’</p>

<p>This conversation took place at the Water House
one afternoon at the beginning of October. Beatrix<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
and her companion, Madame Leonard, had been
away for nearly two months, living quietly at
Whitby and other seaside places, and Beatrix had
come back improved in health and spirits.</p>

<p>Sir Kenrick had been absent six months, and
was likely to return at the end of the year, unless
the war continued. He would not care to leave the
army while there was any hard fighting going on,
and his regiment was in the thick of it. Mrs. Dulcimer
loudly lamented this Burmese outbreak, which
made it impossible for Kenrick to sell out with a
good grace yet awhile. She was always talking to
Beatrix about him, and entreating to hear little bits
of his letters. Lately there had been an irregularity
in the letters. Kenrick’s regiment had been moving
about. He had been off the track of civilization and
postal facilities.</p>

<p>One morning in October, just a week before
Bella’s wedding day, there came a startling letter—a
letter which Beatrix brought to Mrs. Dulcimer.</p>

<p>‘Oh, my dear, my dear!’ cried the Vicar’s wife,
‘something dreadful has happened to Kenrick. I see
it in your face. Is he dead?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

<p>This last question was almost a shriek, and it
was evident that Mrs. Dulcimer was prepared to go
into hysterics at a moment’s notice.</p>

<p>‘No,’ answered Beatrix, ‘but he has been
severely wounded, and he is on his way home.’</p>

<p>‘Coming home,’ cried Mrs. Dulcimer, ‘how delightful!
But severely wounded! How dreadful!’</p>

<p>‘He writes in very good spirits, but I think
though he hardly admits as much, that he has been
badly hurt, and very ill from the effects of his
wounds,’ said Beatrix. ‘He wishes you and Mr.
Dulcimer to go to Southampton with me to meet
him.’</p>

<p>‘Dear boy, how touching! Read me a little of
the letter. Do, my love.’</p>

<p>Beatrix complied, and read all her lover’s letter,
save those little gushes of sentiment which she
would have considered it a kind of treason to confide
even to Mrs. Dulcimer.</p>

<p>‘It is selfish of me to ask you to take so much
trouble, perhaps,’ he wrote, ‘but it would make me
very happy if you would come to Southampton to
meet me. I know our good friends the Dulcimers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
would bring you, if you expressed a wish to that
effect. I want to see you directly I land, Beatrix.
I want your dear face to be the first to smile upon
me when the steamer touches the English shore.
The journey would be interminable if I had to wait
till the end of it to see you. I am not very strong
yet, and should be obliged to travel slowly. But if
you will meet me and greet me, I think all my ills
will be cured at once. A week or so at Culverhouse,
with you for my daily companion, will make me as
strong as a lion. I am bringing you home a poor little
leaflet of laurel, dear, to lay at your feet. That last
skirmish of ours brought me to the fore. Happy
accidents favoured me, and our chief has said all
manner of kind things about my conduct at the
retaking of Pegu. I come back to you a major. I
have not said a word yet about selling out. That
shall be as you wish; but I confess that my own
inclination points the other way. This last business
has made me fonder than I used to be of my profession.
I have tasted the sweets of success. What
do you think, love? Could you be happy as a
soldier’s wife? I write this at Alexandria. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
steamer leaves to-morrow, and ought to arrive at
Southampton on the 7th or 8th of November.
Shall I be so blest as to see you among the eager
crowd on the quay when the boat steams into the
famous old docks, whence so many a soldier has
gone to his fate—where there have been such sad
partings and joyous meetings. Come, love, come,
and let me think I do not return unlooked for and
unloved.’</p>

<p>‘What do you think I ought to do, Mrs. Dulcimer?’
asked Beatrix, humbly.</p>

<p>‘Do, my love? Why, go, of course. There isn’t
a doubt about it. Clement and I will take you.’</p>

<p>‘You are very good,’ faltered Beatrix. ‘Yes,
I will go to meet him.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">A WEDDING MARCH.</span></p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Bella’s</span> marriage was to take place on the last day
of October. It had been laid down from the beginning
that it was to be a very quiet wedding. There
was a newness and brightness about that splendid
monument to the late Mrs. Piper in Little Yafford
churchyard which seemed to forbid high jinks at
Mr. Piper’s second nuptials. ‘People might talk,’ as
Mrs. Scratchell said, happily ignorant that people
were talking about her daughter and Mr. Piper with
all their might already.</p>

<p>Hardly anybody was to be invited to the wedding.
This was what Mr. Piper and everybody else
concerned kept on saying; yet every day some fresh
invitation was given. Mr. Piper had a good many
friends among the manufacturing classes, innumerable
middle-aged men with red faces and expansive waistcoats,
every one of whom was, according to Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Piper, the oldest friend he had. These, one by one,
were bidden, with their wives and families,—‘the more
the merrier.’ In no case was the invitation premeditated,
but it came naturally from Mr. Piper’s
lips when he met an old acquaintance on ‘Change, or
in the club-house at Great Yafford.</p>

<p>‘Never mind, my dear,’ he said, apologetically, to
Bella. ‘They are all carriage people. And they’ll
make a fine show at the church door.’</p>

<p>‘But I thought we were going into county society,’
said Bella.</p>

<p>‘So we are, my pet, but we aren’t going to cut old
friends. There’s Joe Wigzell, the jolliest fellow I
know, and making twelve thousand a year out of hat
linings. Mrs. Wigzell’s a perfect lady, and there’s a
fine family of grown-up daughters. You ought to
know the Wigzells.’</p>

<p>‘I think if you want to be in county society you’ll
have to give up your Wigzells,’ said Bella. ‘They
won’t mix.’</p>

<p>‘But they must mix,’ cried Mr. Piper. ‘I shall
make it worth their while to mix. Such dinners as
I shall give will bring the two classes together——’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span></p>

<p>‘Like oil and vinegar,’ said Bella, who was a little
out of humour with her affianced.</p>

<p>These invitations of Mr. Piper’s, given at random,
had swelled the wedding party into an alarming
number. Poor Mrs. Scratchell was troubled in mind
as to how she should seat her guests. There was a
difficulty about the tables. But Mr. Piper made
light of everything. He would have no cutting and
contriving, no humble devices of Mrs. Scratchell’s, no
home-made pastry. He went to Great Yafford and
contracted with the principal confectioner of that
town to supply everything, from the tables and
decorations down to the salt spoons. The breakfast
was to be a magnificent banquet, at a guinea a head,
exclusive of wines, and Mr. Piper was to write a
cheque for everything.</p>

<p>This arrangement pleased everybody except Bella,
whose pride was keenly wounded by it.</p>

<p>‘You have made a pauper of me among you,’ she
cried angrily, to the family circle, on the night before
her wedding. ‘I had rather have had the quietest,
simplest breakfast that mother could have arranged,
with the Dulcimers and Beatrix Harefield for our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
only visitors, than all this finery paid for by Mr.
Piper.’</p>

<p>‘Fiddlesticks!’ exclaimed Mrs. Scratchell. ‘You
weren’t ashamed to take his money for your wedding
clothes. Why should you be ashamed of his paying
for your wedding breakfast? I hate such
humbug.’</p>

<p>‘I have a little pride left,’ said Bella.</p>

<p>‘Very little, I should think,’ answered her father,
‘and what you have doesn’t become you. It’s like
the peacock’s feathers on the jackdaw. You weren’t
born with it.’</p>

<p>‘Come upstairs and let us try on the wedding
bonnets,’ said Clementina. ‘And be kind and nice,
Bella. Recollect it is your last night at home.’</p>

<p>‘Thank God for that, at any rate,’ ejaculated Bella,
piously.</p>

<p>The house had been transformed by an artificial
and almost awful tidiness. Everything had been put
away. The swept and garnished rooms were scarcely
habitable.</p>

<p>‘I never saw such discomfort,’ cried Mr. Scratchell,
looking discontentedly round his office, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
smelt of soft soap, and was cleaner than he had ever
seen it in his life.</p>

<p>His papers had all been stowed away, he knew
not where. Valuable leases and agreements might
have been thrust into obscure corners where they
would be forgotten. The whole process horrified
him.</p>

<p>‘You oughtn’t to have touched my office,’ he said,
‘business is business.’</p>

<p>‘I couldn’t help it,’ pleaded Mrs. Scratchell.
‘The men from Great Yafford said we must have a
room for the gentlemen to put their hats and things,
so I was obliged to give them this. You have no
idea how they order us about. And then they asked
me where they were to put your things, and almost
before I told them, and while I was so flurried I
scarcely knew what I was saying, your papers and
tin boxes were all swept off.’</p>

<p>‘And pray where are they?’ demanded Mr.
Scratchell, furiously.</p>

<p>‘I—don’t be angry, Scratchell. I couldn’t help
it. They’re all safe—quite, quite safe—in the hay-loft.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span></p>

<p>‘Where the rats are eating the Harefield leases,
no doubt,’ said Mr. Scratchell.</p>

<p>‘It’s for a short time, dear,’ said Mrs. Scratchell,
soothingly. ‘We’ll put everything back in its place
the day after to-morrow; and I don’t think rats
like parchment.’</p>

<p>The wedding day dawned, and to all that busy
and excited household the sky seemed to be of
another colour, and the atmosphere of another
quality than the sky and atmosphere of common
days. The Scratchell girls rose with the lark, or
rather with the disappearance of the cockroaches
in the old kitchen, where those black gentlemen
scampered off to their holes, like Hamlet’s ghost,
at cockcrow. The younger sisters were in high
spirits. The idea of an inordinately rich brother-in-law
opened a new hemisphere of delight. What
picnics, and carpet dances, and other dissipations
Bella could provide for them when she was mistress
of Little Yafford Park! To-day they were
to wear handsome dresses for the first time in
their lives; dresses of Bella’s providing. As
bridesmaids they were important features in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
show. The maid-of-all-work was no less excited.
She, too, was to wear a fine dress; and she had
the prospect of unlimited flirtation with the young
men from the pastrycook’s. She brought the girls
an early cup of tea, and helped them to plait
their hair. Ordinary plaits would not do for to-day.</p>

<p>‘I’ll have mine plaited in ten, if you can
manage it, Sally,’ said Flora.</p>

<p>‘And I’ll have mine in the Grecian plait,’ said
Clementina.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know what’s the matter with Miss
Beller,’ said the faithful Sally. ‘It’s my belief
she has been crying all night. Her eyes are as
red as pickled cabbage. All I can say, if she
isn’t fond of Mr. Piper she ought to be. I never
see such a free-spoken, open-handed gentleman.’</p>

<p>Mr. Piper was intensely popular in the Scratchell
household. Nobody considered that Bella was
sacrificing herself in marrying so charming a man.
His fifty years, his puffiness, his coarse red hands,
about which Nature had made a trifling mistake,
and supplied thumbs in place of fingers, his bald
head with its garnish of iron-gray bristles—all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
these things went for nothing. He had won
everybody’s favour, except perhaps that of his
young bride.</p>

<p>At a quarter to eleven everybody was ready;
Mr. Scratchell in an entire new suit, which circumstance
was such a novelty to him that he
felt as if he had been changed in his sleep, like
the tinker in the old story; Mrs. Scratchell,
flushed and nervous, tightly encased in a shining
purple silk gown, which made her presence felt
as a mass of vivid colour wherever she appeared,
like a new stained glass window in an old church.
The bridesmaids looked bright and pretty in sky-blue,
with wreaths of forget-me-nots round their
white chip bonnets. The boys wore sleek broadcloth,
like their father’s, buff waistcoats and
lavender trousers. Everything was intensely new.
They all stood in the hall waiting for the bride,
and contemplating each other curiously, like strangers.</p>

<p>‘I never thought father could have come out so
good-looking,’ whispered Clementina to her eldest
brother. ‘I should hardly have known him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span></p>

<p>‘Ah!’ ejaculated Herbert, ‘money makes all
the difference.’</p>

<p>They felt as if they were all going to be rich
now. It was not Bella only who went up in the
social scale. Her family ascended with her. Even
the faithful domestic drudge, Sally, rejoiced at the
change in her fortunes. The fragments that fell
to her share after the family dinner would be
daintier and more plentiful. Her scanty wages
would be more secure.</p>

<p>At last Bella came down, in glistening white
apparel, clouded over with lace. That delicate
taste which had always been hers, the instinctive
refinement in all external things which made her
mother say that Bella had been a lady from her
cradle, had regulated her wedding dress. She
looked as pure and aërial as some pale spring
floweret, tremulous upon its slender stem. Her
family bowed down and worshipped her, like
Joseph’s brethren, as represented in the vision of
the sheaves.</p>

<p>‘God bless you, my pet!’ cried her father, in
an unprecedented burst of affection. ‘It is something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
to have such a beauty as you in one’s
family.’</p>

<p>The gray old chancel was like a bed of gaudy
tulips, so varied and so brilliant were the dresses
of Mr. Piper’s manufacturing friends, waiting impatiently
to behold him at the altar. Among all
these bright colours and startling bonnets, Beatrix
Harefield, in her gray silk dress and old Brussels
lace, looked like a creature belonging to another
world. All the manufacturing people noticed her,
and wanted to know who that distinguished-looking
young lady was. Mrs. Dulcimer and Beatrix
had the Vicarage pew all to themselves.</p>

<p>Presently the bride entered the porch, leaning
on her father’s arm, pale against the whiteness of
her bridal dress. Mr. Piper, crimson with agitation,
and breathing a little harder than usual,
hurried forward to receive her. He offered her
his arm. The four bridesmaids followed, two and
two, the organist played a spirited march, and the
business of the day began.</p>

<p>Bella gave the responses in a clear little voice.
Mr. Piper spoke them with gruff decision. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
Dulcimer read the service beautifully, but Mr.
Piper’s manufacturing friends hardly appreciated
the Vicar’s deliberate and impressive style. They
would rather have had the ceremony rattled over
with modern celerity, so that they might get to the
wedding breakfast.</p>

<p>‘If there’s any hot <i>ontries</i> they’ll be spoiled,’
whispered Mrs. Wigzell, the hat-lining manufacturer’s
wife, to Mrs. Porkman, whose husband
was in the provision line.</p>

<p>‘I’m beginning to feel quite faint,’ answered
Mrs. Porkman. ‘Getting up so early and coming
so far! It’s trying for a weak constitution.’</p>

<p>‘Did you ever see such a young thing?’ asked
Mrs. Wigzell, indicating the bride with a motion of
her head.</p>

<p>Mrs. Porkman’s only answer was a profound sigh.</p>

<p>‘What can be expected from such an unsuitable
marriage?’ demanded Mrs. Wigzell, still in
a whisper. ‘After such a sensible wife as poor
Moggie, too.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, my dear, Moggie Piper never rose to the
level of her position,’ answered Mrs. Porkman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span></p>

<p>And now all was over, and for ever and ever—or
at least for the ever and ever of this lower
world—Ebenezer Piper and Isabella Scratchell were
made one. Whatever the incongruity of the union,
the thing was done. Disgrace or death only could
loosen the knot.</p>

<p>The organ crashed out the tremendous chords
of the Wedding March, everybody looked delighted
at the near prospect of breakfast. People crowded
into the vestry to see Bella and her husband sign
the register. There was much kissing of bride and
bridesmaids, while poor Mrs. Scratchell, wedged
into a corner by the vestry door, wept a shower of
hot tears over her purple dress.</p>

<p>‘I hope she’ll be happy,’ she ejaculated. ‘Marriage
is a solemn thing. God grant she may be
happy.’</p>

<p>And in her inmost heart the mother prayed and
feared lest all should not be well with her daughter
in this marriage which she as well as her husband
had striven so hard to bring to pass.</p>

<p>‘We have done all for the best,’ she told herself,
‘and Mr. Piper is a kind, good man.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span></p>

<p>Her maternal heart thrilled with pride presently
at the church door when she saw the manufacturing
people’s carriages, the sleek well-groomed horses,
the smart liveries, the consequential coachmen and
pampered footmen. They were a long time getting
away from the church, and there was a good deal
of fuss, and some offence given to punctilious minds,
in bringing the carriages to the porch. Mrs. Porkman’s
landau came before Mrs. Wigzell’s, which
was wrong, as everybody knows that hat linings
rank before provisions; and the great Mr. Timperley
of the Linseed Mills—quite the most important
person present—was left with his aggrieved wife
and daughter till nearly the last. However, they
all got off ultimately, and five minutes brought them
to Mr. Scratchell’s door.</p>

<p>The breakfast was laid on two long tables in
the common parlour; the best parlour did duty as
a reception-room, and for the display of the wedding
presents, which were exhibited on a side table.
Mr. Piper’s friends had all sent offerings, scaly
golden snakes with emerald or ruby eyes, mother-o’-pearl
envelope boxes, filigree bouquet holders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
lockets, fans, personal finery of all kinds. To the
bride of a gentleman in Mr. Piper’s firmly established
position, no one could think of offering the
butter dishes and dessert knives, claret jugs and fish
carvers, pickle bottles and biscuit boxes, which
are presented to modest young couples just setting
up in domestic business. Bella’s presents were
therefore all of a strictly useless character. Beatrix
gave her a set of pearl ornaments, Mrs. Dulcimer
a dressing-case. The Vicar’s gift was a Bible in an
exquisite antique binding, and a pocket edition of
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>‘You need never be at a loss for something
worth reading while you have those two books,
my dear,’ he told Bella when he presented them.</p>

<p>The breakfast was a success. The Great Yafford
confectioner had done his duty. There were
perigord pies, and barley sugar temples, hecatombs
of poultry and game, highly decorated hams and
tongues, trifles, jellies, creams, hothouse fruit, ices,
wafers, coffee and liqueurs. To the minds of the
young Scratchells it was the most wonderful feast.
They played havoc among all the dishes, reckless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
of after-consequences. Such a banquet as that was
well worth the cost of a bilious attack. The wines
had been sent from the Park, and were the choicest
in Mr. Piper’s collection.</p>

<p>‘There’s a bookay about that ‘ock,’ said Mr.
Porkman, smacking his lips approvingly, ‘that I
don’t remember to have tasted for the last ten years.
You don’t get such ‘ock now-a-days. Money won’t
buy it, no more than it won’t buy Madeira.’</p>

<p>‘I hope you’ll crack many a bottle before the
next ten years, Porkman,’ roared Mr. Piper. ‘It’s
Skloss Johnny’s Berger that I bought out of old
Tom Howland’s cellar, after the poor old gentleman’s
death. He was a Connysewer, was Tom.
I’ve got a whole bin, and it will be your fault if
you don’t punish it.’</p>

<p>‘And so I will, sir, for it’s real good stuff,’
answered Mr. Porkman, blinking at the straw-coloured
wine in his green glass.</p>

<p>The newly-married couple were to spend their
honeymoon in Italy. Coarse as he was in appearance
and manners, Mr. Piper had vague yearnings
after the pleasures of refinement. He wanted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
see the cities of Italy, and the pictures and statues
with which he had been informed those cities
abounded. He had not cared to travel in the first
Mrs. Piper’s time, firstly because that lady’s health
had been precarious, and secondly because she could
not speak a word of any language except her own.
Mr. Piper wanted a companion who could interpret
for him, and assist him to squabble with innkeepers
and hackney coachmen. Such a companion he felt he
could have in Bella, and he would take a pride in exhibiting
his pretty young wife at table-d’hôtes and
in public places. He would like to be pointed out
as a comfortable well-to-do man of middle age who
had married a girl young enough to be his daughter.
He was not ashamed of the disparity. It flattered
his vanity.</p>

<p>Bella looked very pretty by and by in a fawn
coloured travelling dress and a pale blue bonnet.
There was a carriage and four to take Mr. Piper and
his bride to the railway station at Great Yafford.
He had insisted upon four horses, though two could
have done the work just as well. The postillions
were an imposing spectacle—smartly clad in sky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
blue jackets, with satin favours pinned upon their
breasts, and slightly the worse for beer. Happily the
hired horses were of a sober breed, or Mr. and Mrs.
Piper might have come to grief on the first stage of
their journey.</p>

<p>They were gone—amidst the usual shower of old
slippers. The wedding guests departed immediately
after. There was to be no dance, nothing to wind
up the evening, as Clementina and all her younger
sisters and brothers loudly lamented.</p>

<p>‘I should think you’d better all go off to your
beds, after the way you stuffed yourselves all through
the breakfast,’ said Mr. Scratchell. ‘I saw you.’</p>

<p>‘What was the use of leaving things?’ demanded
Herbert. ‘The pastrycook’s men will take everything
back. They won’t leave us a crumb for to-morrow.’</p>

<p>Herbert was right. The confectioner’s men were
already sweeping off the fragments of the feast—half-tongues—bodies
of fowls—dilapidated pies.
Mrs. Scratchell stood and watched them with regretful
looks. The family might have subsisted for a week
upon the savoury remains. The small Scratchells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
prowled round the tables and picked little bits out of
the plates. Those manufacturing people had been
delicate and wasteful in their eating. The broken
bits were daintier than anything the little Scratchells
had ever tasted before.</p>

<p>‘Come, clear out,’ cried the father, ‘you’ve all
eaten too much already.’</p>

<p>But he thought it a hard thing that the pastrycook’s
men should come down, like the locusts of
Scripture, and make barrenness in the land, after Mr.
Piper had paid for everything.</p>

<p>The house had a desolate look when the van had
driven off with all the glass and china and long deal
tables, the epergnes and artificial flowers. Bella’s
room looked unutterably dismal. It was but a poor
attic, at best, and now, in the untidiness of departure,
strewed all over with crumpled scraps of
paper, ends of old ribbon, cast-off cuffs and collars,
and worn-out shoes, looked horrible. The younger
sisters explored the chamber after all was over, in the
faint hope of gleaning something valuable.</p>

<p>‘She hasn’t left a morsel of anything behind her,’
said Clementina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span></p>

<p>‘I don’t think you can complain of that,’ said
Flora. ‘She’s given us all her old clothes.’</p>

<p>‘If she’d had a spark of generosity she’d have
given us some of her new,’ answered Clementina.
‘This is to be my room now. It’s a horrid hole. I’m
sure the furniture must have been second-hand when
Noah built the ark. Think of Bella, with her apple-green
bedroom and dressing-room at the Park—all
the furniture new and her own choice—and her
barouche and pair—and her brougham for evenings.
Doesn’t it seem too ridiculous?’</p>

<p>Clementina went to the shabby little looking glass
on the chipped mahogany chest of drawers, and submitted
her small blunt features to a severe scrutiny.</p>

<p>‘I’m not particularly ugly, and I’ve Bella’s complexion,
which is the best part of her,’ she said, ‘but
I don’t suppose there’s a Mr. Piper growing for me
anywhere.’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, there is,’ answered the cheerful Flora.
‘Bella will give lots of parties, and we shall meet
with young manufacturers.’</p>

<p>‘Bella will do nothing except for her own gratification,’
said Clementina. ‘She won’t give parties to
please us.’</p>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">KENRICK’S RETURN.</span></p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">In</span> the dull dark days of November Mr. and Mrs.
Dulcimer took their ward to Southampton, there to
await her lover’s return. They were to spend a week
at Culverhouse with Sir Kenrick, and then he was to
go with them when they went back to Little Yafford.
Mrs. Dulcimer had planned it all. If Kenrick was
ailing still—though that was not likely, Mrs. Dulcimer
said, after the sea voyage—Rebecca could nurse
him. There was no beef tea like Rebecca’s, no such
calves’ foot jelly.</p>

<p>They went to the Dolphin Hotel at Southampton,
and Mr. Dulcimer at once descended upon the old
book-shops in the High Street, like a vulture upon
carrion—very much like a vulture, since he cared
only for the dead. Mrs. Dulcimer took Beatrix for
a gentle walk, which meant a contemplation of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
the shop windows. Beatrix looked pale and out of
spirits.</p>

<p>‘I know you are anxious about Kenrick,’ said
Mrs. Dulcimer.</p>

<p>Beatrix blushed. Her conscience smote her for
not being anxious enough about her wounded lover.
Had it been Cyril thus returning, what agonies of
hope and fear would have rent her breast! But it
was only Kenrick, the man she had promised, out of
simple gratitude and esteem, to marry. Her feeling
about him, as the hour of their meeting drew nigh,
was an ever-increasing dread.</p>

<p>The day came for the arrival of the steamer.
The weather had been favourable, late as it was in
the year, and the boat came into the docks on the
very day she was expected. Mrs. Dulcimer and
Beatrix had been walking on the platform for an hour
in the afternoon, when the Vicar came bustling up
to them.</p>

<p>‘The steamer is just coming in,’ he cried, and
they were all hurried off to the docks.</p>

<p>There were a great many people, a crowd of
anxious faces all looking towards the open water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
across which the big steamer was cleaving her steady
way.</p>

<p>Who was that on the high bridge beside the
captain, looking shoreward through a glass?</p>

<p>‘Kenrick,’ exclaimed Mr. and Mrs. Dulcimer
simultaneously.</p>

<p>Beatrix saw nothing. The docks and the people,
the blue bright water outside, the muddy green water
inside, the big gaily painted steamer, swam before
her eyes. He was coming. He was coming to claim
the fulfilment of her promise. That weak moment
in which she had yielded to an impulse of grateful
feeling now meant life-long misery.</p>

<p>A few minutes more and he was standing by her
side, her hand clasped in his, Mr. Dulcimer giving
him hearty welcome, Mrs. Dulcimer in tears, Beatrix
dumb as a statue.</p>

<p>‘Oh, my poor dear Kenrick,’ cried the Vicar’s
wife when she could find a voice. ‘How changed
you are—how fearfully changed!’</p>

<p>‘I’ve been very ill,’ he answered, quietly. ‘I
didn’t want to frighten you all, so I made rather
light of it in my letter. But I’ve had a narrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
escape. However, here I am, and I don’t mean to
knock under now.’</p>

<p>The change was startling. The elegant and aristocratic-looking
young man, whom they had parted
from less than a year ago, was transformed into a
feeble invalid, whose shoulders were bent with
weakness, and across whose cadaverous cheek there
appeared the deep cicatrice of a sabre wound. There
was nothing absolutely repulsive in Kenrick’s aspect,
but there was enough to make love itself falter.</p>

<p>They got him into a fly and drove off to the
Dolphin, while Mr. Dulcimer stayed behind to look
after the luggage.</p>

<p>‘Beatrix,’ said Kenrick, when they were seated
opposite each other in the fly, ‘I have not heard
your voice yet, and it is your voice that I have been
hearing in my dreams every night on board the
steamer.’</p>

<p>‘I am very sorry to see you looking so ill,’ she
answered, gently.</p>

<p>‘My boot maker or my tailor would say as much
as that. Tell me you are glad to see me—me—even
the poor wreck I am.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span></p>

<p>There are pardonable hypocrisies in this life.
Beatrix’s eyes brimmed over with tears. She was
deeply sorry for him, sorry that she could find no
love for him in her heart, only infinite pity.</p>

<p>‘I am very glad you are safe at home,’ she said,
‘we have all been anxious about you.’</p>

<p>A poor welcome for a man who had lived through
six months’ hard fighting with brown Buddhist
soldiers, for the sake of this moment. But he could
not upbraid his betrothed for unkindness just now.
Mrs. Dulcimer was there, tearful but loquacious, and
he could not open his heart before Mrs. Dulcimer.</p>

<p>After breakfast next morning Kenrick asked
Beatrix to go for a walk on the platform with him.
They were to drive over to Culverhouse Castle in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>It was a dim autumnal morning, the opposite
shore veiled in mist, the water a dull gray, everything
placid and subdued in colour—a morning that
had the calmness and grayness of advancing age—the
dull repose which befits man’s closing years.</p>

<p>‘My dearest love, your letters have been all
kindness,’ said Kenrick. ‘There has not been much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
love in them, but I suppose I have no right to complain
of that. You did not promise to love me.
Your letters have made me happy. But yesterday
I confess I was wounded by your reception of me.
You were so cold, so silent. I looked in vain for the
greeting I had foreshadowed. It seemed that you
had come to meet me as a duty, that you wished
yourself away. And then I thought perhaps the
change in me was too great, that you were horror-struck
at seeing so deplorable a wreck. If this was
the cause of your silence——’</p>

<p>‘It was not,’ cried Beatrix, eagerly. ‘Pray do not
imagine anything of the kind. The change in you
makes no difference in me. I am proud to think
that you have done your duty, that you have been
brave and noble, and have won praise and honour.
Do you suppose I do not like you better for that?’</p>

<p>‘If I thought otherwise, Beatrix, if I fancied that
you were revolted by my lantern jaws, and this ugly
gash across my cheek, I would say at once let all be
at an end between us. I would give you back your
freedom.’</p>

<p>‘I could not accept it on such terms. There is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
nothing revolting in your appearance. If there were,
if you were maimed and scarred so as to be hardly
recognisable, I would remember that you had been
wounded in the performance of your duty, and I
would honour your wounds. No, Kenrick, believe
me <i>that</i> could not make any barrier between us.’</p>

<p>‘Yet there is a barrier.’</p>

<p>She had not the cruelty to answer the cold
hard truth. He was ill and weak. He looked
at her with eyes that seemed to implore any deception
rather than a reality that would crush
him. He had loved her and believed in her,
when the man she loved had doubted and left
her. He was at least entitled to gratitude and
regard.</p>

<p>‘I have promised to be your wife, and I am
going to keep my promise,’ she said, gravely.</p>

<p>‘Then I am happy. Shall it be soon, dearest?’</p>

<p>‘It shall be when you like after the new
year.’</p>

<p>‘And am I to leave the army?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ she answered, quickly. ‘I am proud of
your profession. I should be very sorry if for my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
sake you were to exchange the career of a soldier
for the stagnation of a country gentleman’s life.’</p>

<p>‘There would be no stagnation for me at Culverhouse;
yet I had much rather remain in the
army. But is my profession to separate us? You
may not like to go to India.’</p>

<p>‘It will be my duty to go with you.’</p>

<p>‘My love, I have no words to say how happy
you have made me. It would have been a grief
to give up my profession, but I would have done
it without a word, in obedience to your wish.’</p>

<p>‘A wife should have no wish about serious
things in opposition to her husband,’ answered
Beatrix.</p>

<p>They were at Culverhouse Castle before dusk,
and again the village gossips were bobbing to
Beatrix, this time with the assurance, derived
from Betty Mopson’s direct assertion, that she
was to be their Lady Bountiful, the source of comfort
and blessing at Christmastide, and in all
time of trouble.</p>

<p>They spent a calm and quiet week at the
castle. Beatrix liked the gray old buildings, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
their quaint mixture of ecclesiastical and domestic
uses. First a castle, then an abbey, then a good
old Tudor dwelling-house. That was the history
of Culverhouse. Kenrick brought out old county
chronicles to prove what a big place it had been
in its time. How it had belonged to a warrior
of the Culverhouse breed in the days of the first
crusade; how it had been afterwards surrendered
to the Church by a sinning and repenting Culverhouse;
and how, after sequestration and malappropriation
under the tyrant Harry, it had come
back by marriage to the Culverhouses, in a most
miraculous way.</p>

<p>‘Your house seems to have always been buttressed
by heiresses,’ said Mr. Dulcimer, poring
over a musty parchment that Kenrick had produced
for his inspection. ‘You have been a very
lucky family.’</p>

<p>‘Luckier than we have deserved, I fear,’ answered
Kenrick, with a glance at Beatrix.</p>

<p>They all went to Little Yafford at the end of
the week, and Kenrick was established at the
Vicarage, under strict charge of Rebecca. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
worthy woman exercised an awful tyranny over
him, feeding him with jellies and soups with as
off-hand authority as if he had been a nest of
young thrushes, or a turkey in process of fattening
for Christmas. He bore it all meekly, for was
not Mrs. Dulcimer the best friend he had, since
it was she who had first suggested his winning
Beatrix?</p>

<p>They were to be married early in the year.
Everybody was talking about it already. It
would be a much more interesting marriage than
Mr. Piper’s second nuptials, though that event had
kept the village gossips alive for full six weeks.
The tide of popular feeling had turned, and Beatrix
now stood high in the estimation of her neighbours.
Even Miss Coyle was silent, contenting
herself with an occasional shrug of her shoulders,
or a significant elevation of her grizzled eyebrows.
The slander had died a natural death, it had expired
of inanition.</p>

<p>Beatrix and her lover saw each other daily.
Madame Leonard was delighted with the wounded
soldier, who had fought so well at Pegu. Everybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
praised him. Even Beatrix’s manner grew
a shade warmer, and she began to feel a calm
and sober pleasure in her lover’s company, such
a mild regard as she might have given to an
elder brother, with whom she had not been
brought up.</p>

<p>As Kenrick grew stronger they rode together
across the wild bleak moor, and the fierce winds
blew health and power into the soldier’s lungs.
Kenrick spent some of his evenings at the dull
old Water House, in that pretty white panelled
sitting-room that had been so long shut up.
Madame Leonard petted and pampered him in
her cordial little way. Beatrix was kind, and
read or played to him according to the humour
of the hour. It was a placid, happy life.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">MR. SCRATCHELL GOES TO LONDON.</span></p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> short days and fireside evenings of December,
and the festivities of Christmas, were to Sir Kenrick
Culverhouse brief and fleeting as a dream when one
awakeneth. He had never been so happy in his
life. To ride across the dull brown moorland with
Beatrix, looking down upon the smiling village
nestling in the hollow of the dark hills; to sit by
her side in the lamplight listening while she read
or played; these things made the sum of his delight.
Life had nothing for him beyond or above them.
And thus the weeks slipped by till February, and
the 10th of February was to be Sir Kenrick’s
wedding day. He had improved wonderfully in
health by this time. His bent back had straightened
itself. He was able to endure the fatigue of a
day’s fishing, in the wintry wind and rain. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
altogether a changed man. Yorkshire breezes had
done much for him, but happiness had done more.</p>

<p>‘How he loves you!’ cried Mrs. Dulcimer to
Beatrix one day, in a rapture of admiration for her
<i>protégée</i>. ‘I never saw a man so devoted.’</p>

<p>‘Do you really think he is so very fond of me?’
asked Beatrix, gravely.</p>

<p>‘My dear, how sad and distressed you look! as
if his love were a thing to be sorry about. Yes,
I do think and know so. Can you for a moment
doubt it?’</p>

<p>‘I have fancied that our marriage was on both
sides rather one of convenience than inclination. He
can give me the protection of an honourable name,
my fortune can free his estate. We like each other
very much, and, I hope, esteem each other. But
I don’t think there is much love on either side. He
makes pretty speeches, of course. That is a compliment
to my sex and my fortune. Don’t you remember
Mr. Dulcimer telling us that Solon made it
a law that heiresses should be treated with particular
respect?’</p>

<p>‘I know nothing about Solon,’ exclaimed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
Vicar’s wife, getting angry, ‘but I know that poor
young man is passionately in love with you. Why,
child, he idolizes you. One can see it with half
an eye.’</p>

<p>‘Then I am very sorry for him,’ said Beatrix, and
there was an earnestness in her tone that startled
the easy-tempered Mrs. Dulcimer.</p>

<p>‘Sorry that your affianced husband is devoted to
you! My dear Beatrix, you must be going out of
your mind.’</p>

<p>‘I sometimes think I am,’ answered Beatrix, in a
low voice.</p>

<p>This conversation occurred about a fortnight
before the wedding day. It made Mrs. Dulcimer
very uncomfortable, but she said no word about it to
anybody, not even to her chosen confidante, Rebecca.</p>

<p>Was it possible, poor Mrs. Dulcimer asked herself,
that this match, the crowning glory of all her efforts,
was going to turn out ill?</p>

<p>Beatrix sent for Mr. Scratchell next day, and
received him alone in her morning-room.</p>

<p>‘I suppose you know that Sir Kenrick’s estate is
heavily encumbered?’ she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered the lawyer, ‘of course that will
be considered in the settlements. It will be my care
to protect your interests.’</p>

<p>‘Never mind my interests or the settlements, yet
awhile. I want to pay off those mortgages before
there is any question of settlements.’</p>

<p>‘You pay them off, before you are Sir Kenrick’s
wife! My dear Miss Harefield, what an extraordinary
notion!’</p>

<p>‘I cannot see that. My money is to release the
estate sooner or later. That is an understood thing
between Sir Kenrick and me. Why should I not do
it before I am his wife? I, Beatrix Harefield, for him
as my future husband, am surely able to pay off these
mortgages.’</p>

<p>‘As the title deeds are deposited with Sir Kenrick’s
bankers, under an engagement to execute a
formal deed when requested, anybody can pay off the
mortgage,’ answered the lawyer, ‘but there is some
hazard in such a proceeding. Suppose Sir Kenrick
were to die before your wedding day, or were to
offend you. Marriages are sometimes broken off, you
know. At the church door even. Then again, suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
you were married without a settlement, and Sir
Kenrick were to die without having made a will in
your favour. Failing a son of yours, the estate would
go to his cousin Cyril. Ah, I see that fact rather
startles you,’ said the unconscious lawyer, perceiving
that Beatrix paled at the mention of her lost lover’s
name.</p>

<p>‘These are serious considerations,’ urged Mr.
Scratchell. ‘I should strongly recommend you not
to touch those mortgages with your little finger until
you have two or three sons of your own. Why
should you throw away fifty thousand pounds for
Mr. Cyril Culverhouse’s ultimate benefit?’</p>

<p>‘It will be for Sir Kenrick’s benefit as long as
he lives.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, but Sir Kenrick may not be a long-lived
man. I don’t want to make you unhappy about
him, but I don’t think he looks like one. And then
there are the fortunes of war. He may be killed in
battle. He had a narrow escape last time. It would
be absurd for you to risk fifty thousand pounds upon
such a life as his.’</p>

<p>‘Absurd or not, I am going to run the risk,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
answered Beatrix, with a firmness that frightened
Mr. Scratchell. In a twelvemonth I shall be of age
to do what I like with my money, without consulting
anybody. You may just as well make yourself
agreeable while I am in your power, and let me
have my own way.’</p>

<p>Mr. Scratchell hesitated, sorely perplexed. To
make himself disagreeable to Beatrix, even in the
endeavour to protect her interests, might be fatal.
Women are such self-willed, unreasonable creatures,
he argued within himself. If he thwarted her in
this ridiculous whim, she might resent his conduct
all her life. In a year, as she had reminded him,
she would be sole mistress of her fortune. She
might dismiss him from his agency, which would be
simple and unmitigated ruin. He was as dependent
upon the Harefield estate for sustenance as a barnacle
on a ship’s bottom. In a word he could not afford to
offend her.</p>

<p>‘You have another trustee to consult,’ he suggested.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Dulcimer? Oh, I know he will consent.’</p>

<p>‘Because he’s a fool.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span></p>

<p>‘No, because he’s a generous-minded man, and
would like to see Sir Kenrick’s estate set free.’</p>

<p>‘Humph!’ muttered the lawyer. ‘It’s a foolish
business altogether. And pray where is the money
to come from?’</p>

<p>‘Have I not stocks or shares, or something that
can be turned into money immediately?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, you have a nice little fortune in consols
and railway debentures. We might scrape up about
thirty thousand that way, perhaps.’</p>

<p>‘Then you can mortgage the Lincolnshire estate
for the other twenty thousand.’</p>

<p>‘Mortgage one estate—your own—to set free
your husband’s! Was there ever anything so preposterous?’</p>

<p>‘I take a warm interest in one estate, and no
interest in the other,’ answered Beatrix. ‘What is
the good of property if one cannot do what one likes
with it?’</p>

<p>‘My dear Miss Harefield, that is the spendthrift’s
argument.’</p>

<p>‘I am no spendthrift, but I want to gratify myself
in this one matter. Now, dear Mr. Scratchell, pray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
be agreeable. Go up to London this afternoon—see
Sir Kenrick’s bankers—sell out the stocks and
shares and things—raise the twenty thousand on the
Lincolnshire land—and get everything done by this
day week.’</p>

<p>‘Impossible, my dear young lady.’</p>

<p>‘Nothing is impossible to a clever family solicitor;
you can do the preliminary act by deposit of my
deeds. Remember, Mr. Scratchell, if you accomplish
this thing for me, I shall always consider myself
deeply bound to you. It is a favour I shall never
forget.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t think I shall be serving you well in this
business.’</p>

<p>‘You will be doing what I wish. I’ll run and
put on my bonnet, and we’ll go at once to Mr.
Dulcimer to get his consent. You must catch the
two o’clock train from Great Yafford. My carriage
can drive you over.’</p>

<p>Beatrix rang and ordered the carriage to be got
ready immediately, and to follow them on to the
Vicarage. Her impetuosity bewildered Mr. Scratchell.
She ran out of the room, and reappeared in a minute or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
so in her bonnet and fur jacket. He felt himself
revolving in a whirlpool. To leave his home at half
an hour’s notice, and go tearing off to London! He
was rather pleased at the idea of a visit to London at
a client’s expense. Travelling, hotel charges, everything
would be paid for him on the highest level.
He had not seen the metropolis for ten years. It
would be an outing such as he had never had in his
life before. He began to hope that Mr. Dulcimer
would consent to his ward’s wild scheme.</p>

<p>They found the Vicar in his beloved library,
surrounded with bulky folios, his feet on the fender,
and his mind a thousand miles away, with the
primitive Aryan races. He was tracing the footsteps
of a nomadic Indian tribe from fertile valleys eastward
of the Caspian, through Persia and Asia Minor,
to the shores of the Hellespont, where they were to
crop up by and by as the Heraclidæ.</p>

<p>‘My dear Beatrix,’ he said, ‘the more I ruminate
upon the subject, the more I am convinced that the
Mosaic account is true, and that all the races of men
have come from one common centre—in the East.’</p>

<p>‘Then how do you account for the woolly-headed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
niggers, and the Laplanders, and the people with pink
eyes?’ inquired Mr. Scratchell.</p>

<p>‘Climate, my dear sir, climate. A question of
atmospheric influences.’</p>

<p>‘Dear Mr. Dulcimer, I have come to ask you a
favour,’ said Beatrix.</p>

<p>‘It is granted beforehand, dear child,’ said the
Vicar, kissing her hand.</p>

<p>The Aryan races had been particularly amenable
to Mr. Dulcimer that morning, and the Vicar, always
good-tempered, was absolutely overflowing with
benevolence.</p>

<p>‘Oh, but this is a very serious matter,’ interposed
Mr. Scratchell, anxious to do his duty.
‘You’ll have to give it your grave consideration.’</p>

<p>‘I’m all attention,’ replied Mr. Dulcimer, with
one eye on the Heraclidæ.</p>

<p>Beatrix explained her desire to set Sir Kenrick’s
estate free.</p>

<p>‘Well, my love, you have always intended to
pay off those charges after your marriage, have you
not?’ asked the Vicar, with a business-like air.</p>

<p>‘Certainly.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span></p>

<p>‘Then I cannot see that it makes any difference
whether you pay them off before or after. Scratchell
can protect your future interests in framing your
marriage settlements. Be sure you see to that,
Scratchell. It is somewhat Quixotic, my dear
Beatrix, to take time by the forelock in this way,
but it can do no harm, and it will afford Kenrick
another evidence of your generous character.’</p>

<p>Mr. Scratchell did not feel himself called upon to
explain to the Vicar all those objections which he had
already expounded to Beatrix. If these people liked
to make fools of themselves, it was not for him to
hinder them. His own interest clearly lay in
pleasing Miss Harefield. To do otherwise would be
to take the bread out of the mouths of his innocent
offspring. And then there was the tempting idea of
a holiday in London, and the prospect of a longish
bill of costs at the end of all. Decidedly it would be
sheer madness stubbornly to oppose this romantic
young lady’s caprice.</p>

<p>Miss Harefield’s carriage was waiting at the
Vicarage gate.</p>

<p>‘It’s a quarter past twelve,’ she said, looking at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
her watch. ‘You have just an hour and three
quarters to pack your carpet bag and drive to the
station. Pray don’t miss the two o’clock train. You
know where to find Sir Kenrick’s lawyers?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Remember, Sir Kenrick is to know nothing
about what we are doing. You are to make that a
condition with his bankers. He is to know nothing
till I choose to tell him. It will not be later
than our wedding-day.’</p>

<p>‘But the settlement?’</p>

<p>‘I will have no settlements,’ said Beatrix, impatiently.</p>

<p>‘My dear Miss Harefield, you must be mad.’</p>

<p>‘At any rate I will have no settlement that can
interfere with my payment of those incumbrances.
That is a free gift to Sir Kenrick, as much as if I
were to give you a hundred-pound note. I never
want to hear about it, or to think about it. I
look upon the fifty thousand pounds as gone—sunk
at the bottom of a well.’</p>

<p>‘You are a most extraordinary young lady.’</p>

<p>‘If you waste your time in wondering at me,
you will lose the London train.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Scratchell got into the carriage obediently,
and was driven to his own house, where his
apparition in a landau drawn by a pair of spirited
horses caused wonder and consternation in all
the household. That wonder increased when Mr.
Scratchell informed his family that he was going
to London on particular business for Miss Harefield,
that he wanted a carpet bag packed with
three or four shirts—his best—meaning those that
were not too conspicuously frayed at the edges of
the pleats and collars—and that his wife and
children were to look sharp, and were not to
bother him with questions.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Scratchell ran off in a flutter to
explore her husband’s wardrobe, in which everything
was more or less the worse for wear, except
the new suit he had bought for his daughter’s
wedding. The girls and boys meanwhile surrounded
their father, like the merchant’s daughters in the
story of Beauty and the Beast, each anxious that
he should bring something from London.</p>

<p>‘Bring me a new dress, papa. If you are
going on Miss Harefield’s business you will get
lots of money,’ pleaded Clementina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>

<p>‘Do bring me a winter bonnet, papa, black
velvet lined with pink,’ asked Flora.</p>

<p>‘You might get us a cricket bat, father,’ said
Adolphus, a boy who always spoke of himself in
the plural, as if to give prominence to his
insignificance.</p>

<p>‘Go and cut me some sandwiches, girls, and
mix me a little weak gin and water in a bottle,’
said Mr. Scratchell. ‘It will be night before I
get to London.’</p>

<p>‘And then you will go to an hotel, I suppose?
Won’t you be grand!’ cried Clementina, who fancied
that the people who stayed at hotels were
a splendid and luxurious race apart from the mass
of mankind.</p>

<p>‘I shall stay at Sam’s Coffee-house in the
Strand,’ said Mr. Scratchell, with a conscientious
air. ‘I am not going to waste Miss Harefield’s
money on fine hotels.’</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later and Mr. Scratchell
had torn himself from the bosom of his family,
and was being driven at a brisk trot towards
Great Yafford.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">THE SECOND MRS. PIPER.</span></p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Bella</span> was reigning at the Park in all the glory
of new-fledged royalty, her husband fascinated
and subservient, her step-children all packed off
to school, the sober old Georgian barrack transformed
by new furniture and improvements of all
kinds. At his wife’s urgent desire Mr. Piper had
bought the estate from Sir Philip Dulcimer, who,
never having liked it, was very glad to turn it
into money, which, carefully invested in railway
shares, might bring him in five or six per cent.,
instead of the scanty two and a half which his
paternal acres had yielded. Mr. Piper was therefore
now Mr. Dulcimer’s patron, as Bella reflected
with a thrill of pride. She had ascended a good
many steps above poor Mrs. Dulcimer, who had
been so patronizingly good-natured to her in the
days of her poverty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span></p>

<p>For the brief three months of his wedded life
Ebenezer Piper had been living in a state of chronic
astonishment. ‘This little woman,’ as he called
his wife, absolutely took his breath away. Her
coolness, her self-assurance, her air of having
been used to the possession of unlimited wealth
from her babyhood, her insolence to people of
higher rank—Lady Jane Gowry, for instance, and
the Pynsents, and all the notabilities of Little
Yafford—these things filled him with admiring
surprise. She was not at all the kind of wife he
had expected to find her. He had chosen her for
her softness and pliability, and he found her hard
and bright as some sparkling gem. He had expected
to rule and govern her as easily as a little
child, and behold! she was ruling and governing
him. He was too much under the spell of her
fascination to complain yet awhile; but this kind
of thing was not at all what he had intended.
He held himself in reserve.</p>

<p>Never was there such a change in any household.
A butler in solemn black, with a powdered
footman for his assistant, took the place of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
decent parlourmaid, in her starched cap and
apron.</p>

<p>The first Mrs. Piper had never consented to
have indoor men-servants.</p>

<p>‘My dear, why don’t you keep a man?’ Mr.
Piper had sometimes inquired. ‘He’d do much
better than these girls of yours, who never quite
know their business.’</p>

<p>‘Piper,’ his wife had answered solemnly, ‘I
am not going to bring you to ruin. The girls are
bad enough, what with their extravagance and
their followers, but a man would eat us out of
house and home before we knew where we were.’</p>

<p>‘Please yourself, my dear,’ returned Mr. Piper,
‘and you’ll please me.’</p>

<p>Thus it was that the Piper establishment had
been conducted upon a strictly middle-class footing.</p>

<p>Now everything was on an aristocratic level.
The present Mrs. Piper had a Frenchwoman for
her own maid. She had a groom in top boots to
sit behind her pony carriage. When she drove in
her barouche the groom sat beside the coachman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
and the two pairs of top-boots had a dazzling
effect. Mr. Piper was rather astonished at the
bootmaker’s bill.</p>

<p>‘My pet, here’s no end of money to pay for
top-boots,’ he remarked. ‘I can’t say I see the use
of ’em. Poor Moggie got on very well without top-boots.’</p>

<p>‘I hope you don’t expect me to go out with a
coachman in trousers,’ exclaimed Bella. ‘I might
as well have a fly from the “Crown” at once.’</p>

<p>‘My love, I should have thought that any kind
of conveyance would have been a novelty to you,
and that you’d hardly have been so particular about
the livery,’ suggested Mr. Piper.</p>

<p>‘I could have gone on foot all my life,’ said
Bella, ‘but if I am to have a carriage I must have
it decently appointed. I don’t want to hang between
heaven and earth, like Mahomet’s coffin.’</p>

<p>Mahomet’s coffin extinguished Mr. Piper. It
had been flung at his head a good many times upon
his venturing to object to his young wife’s extravagance.</p>

<p>‘And after all I am proud to see how well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
she does it,’ he said to himself, smiling an uxorious
smile. ‘She’s a regular little duchess.’</p>

<p>And henceforward in familiar conversation Mr.
Piper was apt to speak of his wife as the ‘Duchess.’</p>

<p>The house—which had now become his freehold—was
made so fine that Mr. Piper hardly knew himself
in it. Persian carpets of vivid and various hues
were spread on the black and white marble of the
hall, brocaded satin curtains, violet lined with amber,
veiled the doors between hall and conservatory.
The drawing-room was pale blue and gold, rich in
easy chairs and tall gilded stands supporting Sèvres
vases filled with flowers.</p>

<p>The chief bedroom was apple-green. Everything
was radiant and smiling, dazzling with gold
and colour.</p>

<p>‘My word! it’s like living in a bower,’ said Mr.
Piper, and he hummed a song that was then not
quite forgotten—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘There’s a bower of roses by Bendemeer’s stream.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Having made her house beautiful, Mrs. Piper’s
next desire naturally was to exhibit her splendour
to the envious eyes of people with inferior houses.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
She therefore began to issue invitations on as large
a scale as the neighbourhood allowed. These were
not all responded to as cordially as she would have
wished. Lady Jane Gowry had honoured Bella
with a condescending call, but she flatly declined
Mr. and Mrs. Piper’s invitation to dinner, on the
ground that at her age she could not afford to
extend the circle of her visiting acquaintance.</p>

<p>‘The people I dine with are people I have
known for half a century,’ she wrote to Mrs. Piper.
‘I am too old to go out often, so I only go to very
old friends. But if you and Mr. Piper like to come
and take a cup of tea with me any Tuesday
evening I shall be very happy to see you.’</p>

<p>‘After all, Lady Jane’s chestnut wig and violet-powdered
complexion are not much loss,’ said Bella.</p>

<p>‘No, they ain’t, but I should like to have taken
the old woman to dinner upon my arm, before the
Porkmans and the Wigzells,’ remarked Mr. Piper.
‘I don’t believe they ever sat down to dinner with
a title in the whole course of their natural lives.
Wouldn’t old Timperley have stared! Earls’ daughters
don’t come his way often, I reckon.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span></p>

<p>Bella found that she would have to content
herself in a great measure with the society of the
Timperleys, the Porkmans, the Wigzells, and all
the ramifications of those family trees. Everybody
in this set was rich, and the chief struggle
of everybody’s life seemed to be to spend more
money upon display than his or her neighbour.
The men boasted of their cellars, and vied with
each other in giving high prices for their wines.
A few loftier spirits bought pictures, and talked
patronizingly of their favourite Royal Academicians.
They seemed to think that Frith and Millais had
been created for them, like Holbein for Henry the
Eighth, or Vandyke for Charles the First. They all
lived in brand-new houses within a few miles of
Great Yafford, houses built by themselves, all spick
and span and fresh from the builder’s hand, with
not so much as an elderly apple-tree on the
premises.</p>

<p>The county people had been condescendingly
civil to the new Mrs. Piper; but that was all.
They called upon her, and contemplated her curiously,
as if she had been something to wonder at, like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
only living gorilla. She was asked to three large
dinners, at which she felt herself less than nobody—though
she wore laces and jewels enough for a
dowager of ancient lineage. Bella, clever as she
was, found that these people’s thoughts were not
her thoughts, nor their ways her ways—and that
all the distance between the east and west was
not wider than the gulf between her and the
county families. But this was a surmountable
difficulty, she told herself. She was quick at learning
languages, and would learn the jargon of the
county families as easily as she had learned Italian.
These scraps of social slang, these continual allusions
to people she did not know, and pleasures she had
never shared, could hardly be so difficult as Dante.</p>

<p>Mr. Piper looked on and admired, while his
young wife wasted his money, laughed at his
friends, and made light of his opinions; but he
was not altogether satisfied or easy in his mind.
It would not be always so, he thought. There
would come a day! The Duchess was carrying
things with a high hand. It was perhaps just as
well to let her have her fling. She was so unaccustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
to the command of money, poor little
woman, that she might be forgiven for spending
it somewhat recklessly. And, after all, this increased
expenditure was pleasanter than poor
Moggie’s carefulness and perpetual lamentations
about butcher’s bills and pounds of butter. Mr.
Piper liked his new butler, and was even in his
heart of hearts not displeased with the powdered
footman or the top-booted groom, though he
affected to despise those follies. He felt himself
on a level with the Timperleys in their scarlet
Tudor mansion, with its jutting windows and
leaden lattices, its deep porch and iron-studded
door, its gilded vane and many gables, at once
intensely old and dazzlingly new. He was living
as became his wealth and social status, living like
the Porkmans and the Wigzells, and the rest of his
purse-proud acquaintance. The first Mrs. Piper
had hung upon him like a log on a hobbled donkey,
and had deprived him of all freedom, with her ever-lasting
economical scruples. He had been afraid
to give a dinner party, knowing that for a month
after there would be ceaseless wailings about the
expense of the feast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span></p>

<p>‘Piper, have you any idea what grouse were
when you asked Mr. Timperley to dinner last
August?’ Mrs. Piper would demand.</p>

<p>‘I know the brace we had were uncommonly
tough, and precious badly cooked,’ Mr. Piper
would retort.</p>

<p>‘They were twelve shillings a brace, Piper.
Here’s the poulterer’s bill to prove it to you. I
call it sinful to eat game at such a price. You
know <i>you</i> ordered them, Piper. I should have
inquired what they were to cost—but you never
do.’</p>

<p>‘I wanted to give Timperley a decent dinner,’
Mr. Piper would reply. ‘Hang it, Moggie! when I
go to Timperley’s he feeds me on the fat of the
land. Besides, we can afford it.’</p>

<p>‘Nobody can afford wanton extravagance,’ Mrs.
Piper would groan; and this kind of conversation
would occur daily.</p>

<p>Thus it was a new thing to Mr. Piper to have
his domestic life administered with liberal-handed
luxury, to hear no complaints about the misconduct
of servants or the price of provisions, not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
be awakened abruptly from his after-dinner nap
to be told that bread had gone up a halfpenny, or
that Scrogfield was charging thirteen-pence for fillet
of veal.</p>

<p>‘Upon my word, little woman,’ he exclaimed
one day, delighted with his wife’s cleverness, ‘you
have made the house a paradise.’</p>

<p>It was still more a paradise after Christmas, for
the second Mrs. Piper, having found out that her
step-daughters were sadly in want of dancing and
calisthenics, which they could not be taught properly
at home, and would be much benefited by being
transplanted to Miss Turk’s boarding school, on the
outskirts of Great Yafford, the school at which
Mrs. Dulcimer and all the best people in the
neighbourhood had been educated, under the aunts
and predecessors of the reigning Miss Turk.</p>

<p>Mr. Piper was rather disappointed, just at first,
by this idea of Bella’s. He had hoped to have his
daughters always at home. They were troublesome,
rude, and noisy, but still Mr. Piper loved them, as
the gladiator loved his young barbarians.</p>

<p>‘I thought you would have gone on teaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
the girls, little woman,’ he said, with a chap-fallen
air.</p>

<p>‘My dear Mr. Piper, what time should I have for
society, or for you, if I did that? Quite impossible.
Besides, the girls will be a great deal better at a
first-rate school. They are too high-spirited to obey
me, and now I am their mamma they would laugh
at my attempts to teach them.’</p>

<p>Mr. Piper sighed and submitted. The boys went
to school, as a matter of course. He had no objection
to that. But he had hoped that his daughters would
stay at home, and cheer his breakfast-table with their
chubby common-place faces and small second-hand
jokes, and thump their pianoforte duets of an
evening for his delectation.</p>

<p>One evil which Mr. Piper had feared in taking
Bella for his wife had not befallen him. He had
fancied that the Park would be overrun with Scratchells,
that Bella, as an affectionate member of a large
family, would want to make his house a free warren
for her father and mother, brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>But this apprehension of Mr. Piper’s was in no
manner realized. Bella sent her family ceremonious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
invitations to her second best parties, and made a
duty call upon her mother after church every
Sunday, a time at which Mrs. Scratchell was less
distracted by thoughts about the kettle or the
kitchen generally than at other periods of her existence;
for the Scratchells always had a cold dinner
on the Sabbath, not so much from piety as from a
conviction of Mrs. Scratchell’s that cold meat went
further than hot.</p>

<p>This kind of intercourse was not what the
Scratchells—especially Clementina and Flora—had
expected; but they were fain to be thankful for the
favours they received, and never carried their murmurs
further than the sacred home circle, where, sitting
round the winter fire, they discoursed at their ease
upon Bella’s worldliness and want of natural feeling.</p>

<p>‘I was so glad when Lady Jane refused to go to
her dinner party,’ said Clementina. ‘We weren’t
asked to that party. Oh no. We were not good
enough to meet Lady Jane—nor the Timperleys
either. And Lady Jane wrote and told Bella that
she only went out to dine with old friends. Wasn’t
that splendid?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span></p>

<p>‘Did Bella tell you?’ asked Mr. Scratchell.</p>

<p>‘Catch her! She’s too proud to tell me she’s
been snubbed. Lady Jane told Mrs. Dulcimer, and
Mrs. Dulcimer told me, and I’ve no doubt everybody
in the village knows all about it by this time.’</p>

<p>‘No doubt,’ sighed Mrs. Scratchell, in her doleful
way. ‘It was a pity Bella put herself so forward.’</p>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">IN THE CHURCHYARD.</span></p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">My</span> dear,’ said Mrs. Dulcimer to Beatrix quite
suddenly one evening, when she and Kenrick were
sitting round the fire in the snug dining-room, a little
while before tea, ‘Cyril must certainly assist at your
marriage.’</p>

<p>Happily for Beatrix, the lamp had not yet been
brought in. There was only the changeful and
uncertain firelight, which just at this moment left
her face in shadow.</p>

<p>‘Well, yes,’ returned Kenrick. ‘I think Cyril
ought to be invited. If he were not present it would
look as if there were some quarrel between us. And
we are very good friends, are we not, dear?’ he added,
turning to his betrothed.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ faltered Beatrix.</p>

<p>‘If he were not here people would talk,’ pursued
Mrs. Dulcimer. ‘You see, Bridford is not more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
thirty miles distant, and, as Kenrick’s first cousin
and Mr. Dulcimer’s late curate, it would be only
natural for Cyril to assist at the ceremony.’</p>

<p>‘I will write and ask him to-morrow,’ said Kenrick.
‘I ought to have thought of it before.’</p>

<p>‘He has been very ill,’ suggested Beatrix. ‘He
may not be strong enough to travel.’</p>

<p>‘Thirty miles only, my dear. A mere nothing,’
said Mrs. Dulcimer. ‘Besides, he has quite recovered—or,
at any rate, he has gone back to his duty. Clement
told me so a week ago.’</p>

<p>‘Kenrick,’ said Beatrix a little later, when she
and her lover were walking to the Water House together
through the wintry night, ‘is it really necessary
for your cousin to be at our wedding?’</p>

<p>‘His absence might cause a scandal, dearest.
Remember, he is my nearest relation, known to be
quite near at hand, and closely associated with this
place. Do you not think that people would say
unpleasant things if we left him out?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ sighed Beatrix, ‘people have a knack of
imagining the worst.’</p>

<p>‘I should be very sorry if any one were to say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
that Cyril was absent from my wedding because he
and my wife feared to meet,’ said Kenrick, with a
sudden pang of jealousy.</p>

<p>‘They shall have no reason for saying anything
of the kind,’ Beatrix answered, proudly. ‘Pray invite
your cousin.’</p>

<p>‘Now you are angry.’</p>

<p>‘Not with you,’ she answered, quickly. ‘I am
angry with the world, life, fate.’</p>

<p>‘What, Beatrix, now, after you have made me so
happy, when all our life is smiling upon us—every
cloud gone?’</p>

<p>Beatrix’s only answer was a sigh. But Kenrick
was rapt in the placid delight of his good fortune.
He loved his betrothed too well to believe it possible
that she did not love him. They had lived so happily,
as it seemed to him, for nearly four months,
in each other’s society. They had never had a dispute—or
even a difference of opinion. Could he
doubt that she had grown fonder of him day by day
in all that time? Her irritation to-night was natural,
he argued. It arose from her scorn of the scandals
that had darkened her young life. It was hard for
her to forget these things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span></p>

<p>Kenrick wrote next day to his cousin:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear Cyril</span>,—The Dulcimers say you ought to
assist at my wedding, and I think the same. Will
you come?</p>

<p>
‘Yours always,<br />
‘<span class="smcap">Kenrick</span>.’<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The answer was very little longer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear Kenrick</span>,—I agree with you and the
Dulcimers. I will come to assist in the ceremony,
and to wish you and your bride all blessings that
this life and the brighter life after can yield.</p>

<p>‘My time is closely occupied here, so my visit
must be of the shortest. I will come on Tuesday
afternoon, and must return on Wednesday, directly
after the wedding.</p>

<p>
‘Yours in all affection and good faith,<br />
‘<span class="smcap">Cyril</span>.’<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>This letter made Kenrick happy. It dispelled
the one uneasiness of his mind, the lurking notion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
that he had helped to spoil his cousin’s peace. Cyril
was evidently reconciled to the existing state of
things. After all it was his own doing, Kenrick
thought. He had no right to complain.</p>

<p>Kenrick showed the letter to Beatrix, who read
it slowly and thoughtfully, and returned it to him
without a word.</p>

<p>‘A gentleman-like letter, isn’t it?’ asked Kenrick.</p>

<p>‘Very,’ she answered.</p>

<p>Did it please her that her former lover should
write in so friendly a tone—that he should be willing
to assist in the solemn act that was to make their
severance irrevocable? No. His willingness stung
her to the quick.</p>

<p>‘He never loved me,’ she thought. ‘It was
Bella’s pretty face that he really cared for. But he
thought my fortune would help him in doing good,
and he was willing to sacrifice his own inclination in
order to be useful to others. He liked me just well
enough, perhaps, to be reconciled to the idea of
marrying me and making use of my fortune. And
then when the slander arose he drew back. Honour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
forbade him marrying a woman the world suspected
of a hideous crime, and whom he did not love.’</p>

<p>Bitter thoughts for the bride of to-morrow!
Tuesday morning had come. Mr. Scratchell had
called at the Water House to tell Miss Harefield
that everything was done according to her wish.
The equitable charge on Kenrick’s estate had been
paid off. Culverhouse Castle was as free as it had
been in the reign of its wealthiest possessors.</p>

<p>‘I am very glad it is done,’ said Beatrix, and
it was the first gladness she had shown for some
days.</p>

<p>Madame Leonard wanted her to be interested
in her trousseau, which was being packed by that
clever little Frenchwoman and the honest unhandy
English maid. Everything had been left to Madame
Leonard.</p>

<p>Beatrix had taken no trouble about this mountain
of new clothes which people had declared she
must have, as if to mark distinctly that to get
married is to turn over a new leaf in the volume
of life.</p>

<p>‘It is all well to let me do in these things,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
to choose ze colours, and to devise ze modes,
but it must be that you interest yourself a little
now that it is all achieved, or I shall think you
are not content,’ remonstrated Beatrix’s companion.</p>

<p>‘Dear Madame Leonard, I am more than content.
But I am not very fond of fine clothes.
They do not fill my mind as they seem to do
with some people.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, my dear,’ cried the Frenchwoman, ‘it is
all very well to be high and mighty; but I can
tell you there are times in a woman’s life when
if she did not think about her dress she would
have nothing to think of. And it is better to
think of a new gown than a new lover. That
amuses. And after all it is innocent. To talk
of dress does no one any harm. It is not like
scandal.’</p>

<p>‘Dear Madame Leonard, you are wiser than
I. But never mind the trousseau just now. Please
pack my plainest dresses and wraps in one trunk.
I am not going to travel with all those huge boxes,
am I?’</p>

<p>‘No, the biggest of those are to be sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
straight to India. And the smaller are to meet
you at Brindisi.’</p>

<p>Sir Kenrick and his bride were to spend their
honeymoon in Paris and in Italy, travelling by
easy stages to Brindisi, whence they were to start
for India early in April, a fact which Mrs. Dulcimer
bitterly bewailed.</p>

<p>‘I thought Kenrick would sell out,’ she said,
‘and that you would divide your lives between
Culverhouse Castle and the Water House.’</p>

<p>‘That would have been to spoil Kenrick’s career,
just as it promises distinction,’ answered Beatrix. ‘I
should regard that as a kind of assassination.’</p>

<p>Upon this last day of her maiden life Beatrix
was strangely absent and troubled in manner.
She shrank even from Madame Leonard’s gentle
sympathy, and while the anxious little woman
was busy with the trunk and packing-cases, the
owner of all that finery paced the garden walk
by the dull gray river, reckless of the biting east
wind, wrapped in gloomy thoughts. The swollen
waters were rushing under the old stone arch,
the moor was darkly purple against a sunless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
sky. All nature seemed in harmony with the
mind of to-morrow’s bride.</p>

<p>The packing business kept Madame Leonard
and Mary closely occupied all day, so Beatrix
was undisturbed. Sir Kenrick had gone to Great
Yafford to get the odds and ends wanted to complete
his outfit. Mrs. Dulcimer was engaged with
her dress for the wedding, which was being made
at home, a process which necessitated frequent
discussions and consultations with Rebecca and
the dressmaker, and which, undertaken from
motives of economy, was likely to result in an
expensive failure. Cyril was not expected till the
evening. He was to arrive in time for the Vicarage
tea, and was to occupy Mrs. Dulcimer’s second
best spare bedroom.</p>

<p>Beatrix had promised to call at the Vicarage
some time in the afternoon. It was a visit she would
gladly have avoided in her present frame of mind,
but she thought if she did not go Mrs. Dulcimer
would be likely to come to the Water House in
quest of her, and that might prove a heavier infliction.
So she put on her bonnet directly after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
luncheon, and walked across the windy bridge,
and up the windy street to the Vicarage. It was
between two and three o’clock, a very safe hour
at which to pay her visit, since Cyril was not
expected until half-past seven. She had seen his
letter to Mrs. Dulcimer, in which he named the
train that was to bring him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dulcimer was in her bedroom, with Rebecca
and the dressmaker. Beatrix went up, at
the housemaid’s request, and found these three
stitching and talking, as fast as tongues and
needles could be driven. The dress had been
three days in hand, but just at the last it was
found necessary to put on an extra pressure to
get it finished. Mrs. Dulcimer was sewing the
braid on the skirt, Rebecca was pushing strips of
whalebone into the body, which looked as stiff as
a strait-waistcoat or a suit of plate-armour; the
dressmaker was cording a flounce. The room was
strewn with snippings of silk, satin, sarcenet, and
lining, as thick as leaves in Vallombrosa. Mrs.
Dulcimer looked the image of anxiety. If she
had been a beauty of seventeen preparing for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
her first ball, or a young actress about to make
her <i>début</i> in London, she could not have been
more deeply concerned.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Beatrix, I am so glad you have come,’
she exclaimed, without stopping her needle. ‘I
long to know if you like it.’</p>

<p>‘It’ was the dress, now in scattered portions.</p>

<p>Beatrix looked puzzled.</p>

<p>‘My love, how absent-minded you are!’ said
Mrs. Dulcimer. ‘Of course you can’t judge of the
general appearance till the flounces are on, and
it all comes together. But you can tell me what you
think of the colour and the style of trimming.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you mean the dress,’ answered Beatrix,
with cruel indifference. ‘I think that silver-gray
is a pretty colour.’</p>

<p>‘It’s the new shade,’ said Mrs. Dulcimer. ‘You
are sure it’s the new shade, are you not, Miss
Killick?’ she asked, turning to the dressmaker.</p>

<p>‘Yes, ma’am, it’s quite the new shade,’ answered
Miss Killick solemnly.</p>

<p>Beatrix seated herself by the fire, and idly
watched the blaze, while Mrs. Dulcimer went on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
working. There was not much sustained conversation.
Everybody except Beatrix was thinking of the
dress. Miss Killick and Rebecca had their mouths
full of pins, and dropped a few whenever they spoke,
like the girl in the fairy tale. After half an hour
or so Beatrix rose to go, but Mrs. Dulcimer entreated
her to stop till the dress was tried on.</p>

<p>‘It will be ready in a quarter of an hour, won’t
it, Miss Killick?’ she inquired.</p>

<p>They were all sitting close together now, Rebecca
sewing the body to the skirt, the dressmaker
sewing on the final flounce.</p>

<p>‘I don’t suppose we shall be much longer,
ma’am,’ said Miss Killick.</p>

<p>‘And at four we are going to have a refreshing
cup of tea,’ said the Vicar’s wife, ‘so you
really must stop, Beatrix.’</p>

<p>Beatrix could not refuse so small a favour, so she
went on staring at the fire; while the three workers
hastened the finish of their task, with their heads
close together, like the three fatal sisters intent upon
the web of some particular destiny which Jove had
ordered them to hurry to its conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span></p>

<p>‘There,’ said the three simultaneously, ‘it’s done.’</p>

<p>Five minutes later Mrs. Dulcimer was standing
before her cheval glass, buttoned into her new gown,
and trying to make it look as if it belonged to her,
every fold having the stiffness, strangeness, and awkwardness
which are characteristic of a new garment.</p>

<p>Beatrix had to assist at the discussion as to
whether the sleeve should not be shortened a quarter
of an inch, or the shoulder seam taken up a little, or
the waist tightened, or the skirt lengthened. When
she found herself free to depart the church clock was
striking the quarter after four. The sky, which had
brightened a little in the afternoon, was yellow in
the west, where the sun would soon go down behind
yonder black ridge of moor. The wind had dropped,
and there was a mildness in the air like the sweet
breath of early spring.</p>

<p>There was a circuitous way to the Water House,
through meadows that lay behind the churchyard.
It was a solitary walk, that Beatrix liked at all times,
and which particularly suited her humour just now.
She went in at the wicket gate in the angle of the
churchyard, and followed the narrow path between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
the crowded headstones,—commonplace memorials
of harmless uneventful lives.</p>

<p>The pathway took her by the side of the fine old
parish church, close by the vestry, which was curiously
squeezed in at an angle between transept and
chancel, under the diamond-paned casement, beside
which the white surplices were hanging, past the
sunken door.</p>

<p>Just as she came to the door it opened, and a
man came out.</p>

<p>She gave a little cry, and the whole scene seemed
to rock before her eyes, the old gray wall, the crumbling
tablets, the leafless elm branches, the tall black
poplars, which rose like watch-towers between her
and the sky. For a moment all seemed in tumultuous
motion, as if a whirlwind had risen. Then,
with a great effort, she clasped the railings of a tomb
close by, and commanded brain and body to be still.</p>

<p>A hand was held out to her, and she took it with
a mechanical air. Her lips moved slowly.</p>

<p>‘Cyril.’</p>

<p>Only his name, and the ice was broken. The
next instant she had burst into passionate tears, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
was hiding her face against the rusty insensible railings,
anywhere, only to be out of his sight.</p>

<p>Her whole frame was shaken by those sobs. He
could not but perceive, he could not even pretend
not to perceive, her distress.</p>

<p>‘Forgive me,’ he said gently. ‘I am more than
sorry that I came, if my presence grieves you. I
ought not to have come, but,’ he faltered a little here,
‘respect for you, regard for my cousin, made it impossible
for me to refuse.’</p>

<p>‘Respect for me!’ she exclaimed bitterly, lifting
up her head, and choking down her sobs with a desperate
effort, just as she had held herself back from
unconsciousness a few moments before. ‘Respect for
me—for a woman whom you could believe a poisoner!’</p>

<p>‘Beatrix, I never believed——’ he began.</p>

<p>‘You did not believe me innocent, or you would
not have forsaken me,’ she said, confronting him with
eyes that kindled as she spoke.</p>

<p>He could not gainsay her. She had spoken truth.
No, not if all the world had been against her, not at
the scaffold’s foot, could he have abandoned her,
could he honestly have believed her guiltless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span></p>

<p>But now that he stood face to face with her, now
that he saw that noble countenance, the splendid
indignation of those eyes, he was as convinced of her
innocence as if he had never doubted her. His past
doubts seemed madness, or worse than madness,
diabolical possession.</p>

<p>‘If I had spoken with you after your father’s
death,’ he said, ‘if we had met face to face as we
meet now, I should never have gone away. I would
have borne the hardest things men could say of me,
that I had married you for the sake of your fortune—that
I had been unscrupulous because you were
rich. I would have laughed such poisoned arrows to
scorn for your dear sake.’</p>

<p>‘You left me,’ she said, growing colder as he grew
warm, gaining strength and firmness as he showed
himself weak. ‘You left me. That is all. Perhaps
you really never cared for me. Indeed, I have some
reason to know there was some one else you secretly
preferred.’</p>

<p>‘<i>That</i> is wholly false,’ cried Cyril. ‘I never loved
but one woman, and you are she.’</p>

<p>‘What does it matter? Why try to explain the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
past? It is all over and done with. To-morrow will
make me your cousin’s wife. And you are come to
assist at my wedding. But how is it you are here
so early? You are not expected at the Vicarage till
half-past seven.’</p>

<p>‘I came by an earlier train than I intended, and
having time to spare I went in to look at the old
church,’ he answered, hurriedly.</p>

<p>‘And to pray for strength to bear to-morrow’s
agony,’ he might have added, for he had been on his
knees before the altar at which he had so often
officiated, praying that his burden might be lightened
for him.</p>

<p>There was a silence. Beatrix still stood with her
back to the railings that guarded the once splendid
tomb of a knight banneret of Elizabeth’s reign. She
had just strength to stand calmly there, steadily confronting
her old lover, but she had no power to drag
her limbs away from the spot. She knew that if she
tried to move she must fall like a log at his feet; so
she stood there, cold and white as the marble the
tomb was made of.</p>

<p>‘Beatrix,’ cried Cyril, losing all mastery of himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
in the bewilderment of being alone with her,
close to her, as far from the outside world in that
quiet corner of the churchyard as if they two had
been lost upon the wildest bit of moorland in the
country. ‘Beatrix, why are you going to marry
Kenrick? Why have you been in such haste to
prove how utterly you had forgotten me?’</p>

<p>‘Are you not glad my wounds have healed so
quickly? You have nothing to reproach yourself
with on my account. Not even a broken heart.’</p>

<p>‘And you love Kenrick?’ he asked, wonderingly.</p>

<p>‘He has never suspected me of a hideous crime.
When every one spoke against me, he was staunch
and true. I am very grateful to him.’</p>

<p>‘Gratitude is not love.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps not, but affection and gratitude are near
akin, and Kenrick is satisfied with affection.’</p>

<p>‘I would not be if I were he,’ cried Cyril, beside
himself with anger and jealousy. ‘I would have
nothing less than your love, your whole-hearted passionate
love. What! be content to dwell beside the
narrow sluggish river, and never sicken for the wide
wild sea? I would not be your husband on such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
terms. I despise my cousin that he can marry
you, knowing, as he must know, that you do not
love him.’</p>

<p>‘You have no right to say that. Do you think
yourself so much better than he that no woman,
having once loved you, can love him?’</p>

<p>‘I know that no true woman ever loved truly
twice. There is no such thing as second love worth
having. It is the mere ghost of feeling, like a rose
cut at midsummer to be shut up in a box and
brought out at Christmas, revived by sulphur fumes—a
phantom flower, with no more bloom or freshness
than if it were made of paper. Just so much
for second love.’</p>

<p>If she could have stirred she would have left
him, but she had still an acute sense of her helplessness.
She must stay and listen, let him say what he
would. What was this conflict of feeling in her breast?
Passionate love, passionate anger, scorn that made it
sweet to wound him, fondness that made her long to
fling herself upon his breast and cry, ‘Oh, give me
shelter, give me rest! Let all the world go by. You
and I can be all the world to each other.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span></p>

<p>The yellow wintry light faded in the west, the
sky grew dull and bleak, the headstones had a grayer
look.</p>

<p>‘Why do you concern yourself about me?’ she
asked bitterly. ‘You have come to assist at my
wedding, in order that the conventionalities may
not be outraged. That is all very right. My name
has been bandied about on people’s lips quite enough
already. It is just as well to avoid the scandal of
your absence. But that ends all between us. We
need never see each other’s faces after to-morrow.
Why should we say hard things, or talk about the
past? Had you not better go to the Vicarage, and
let me go quietly home?’</p>

<p>She was much the calmer of the two, despite that
inward struggle between love and resentment. He
was mad with the pent-up feeling of all those long
dreary days and nights in which he had fought with
his passion, believing he had beaten it, only to find
it now starting up in his soul, indestructible as the
principle of evil.</p>

<p>‘Let you go! No,’ he cried, with his strong
grasp upon her wrist. He who had been weak as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
child a few short weeks ago, was strong now with all
the strength of a desperate tempted soul. ‘No, I
have got you, and I will not let you go. Oh, my
love, my love, my lost and only love, I will not let
you go till I have told you something of the truth.’</p>

<p>His arms were round her now, her head drawn
close to his breast, his eyes looking down into hers,
with fond despairing love, his words hurrying thick
and fast from lips that trembled as they spoke.</p>

<p>‘Yes, you shall hear me, you shall know the
truth—all the mad foolish truth. When your father
died, and people began to whisper, and to shrug their
shoulders, and insinuate vile slanders against you,
the devil got into my mind, as into the minds of
those village gossips, and a horrible fear took hold of
me. I thought it was just possible—just within the
compass of human error—that, maddened by your
father’s tyranny and injustice, you had blackened
your soul with murder—your fair young soul, which
till that hour I had deemed stainless. I saw you at
the inquest, and I thought, God help me, that I
could read guilt in your face and manner. I struggled
against the conviction—I tried to believe you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
innocent, and all the world mistaken—but the more I
fought against it the stronger that conviction grew.
In my darkest hours I believed you guilty—at my
best moments I was doubtful. So I swore I would
pluck your image out of my heart. How could I
cherish you, sin incarnate, and be faithful to my
God? What was my individual happiness upon this
little spot of earth when weighed against duty and
honour? And so I left you, love—went away to
forget you—worked as few men have worked—strove
as few have striven—prayed without ceasing—and
remembered you all the more vividly for the distance
that severed us, and loved you all the more dearly
because I had lost you. And now,’ he cried, straining
her against his heart in one desperate embrace,
pressing his lips to hers in one impassioned kiss,
‘now, marry Kenrick Culverhouse if you dare, and
let the memory of me be your curse, as it is mine to
remember you.’</p>

<p>After that kiss he loosed his hold and let her go.
She tottered a few paces from the railing that
had supported her, and then her feet seemed to get
entangled in the long grass of a neglected grave, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
she fell headlong at the foot of a gloomy old yew
which stretched its crooked branches across her as she
lay, like the scraggy arms of weird women—pointing
to a foredoomed victim of Fate.</p>

<p>Cyril ran back to the vestry to get some water,
and there happily encountered Mrs. Pomfret, the
pew-opener, who had come to dust and garnish the
church for to-morrow’s ceremony.</p>

<p>‘Miss Harefield has fainted,’ he cried. ‘Bring
some water, and see what you can do for her, while I
go and get a fly.’</p>

<p>He went into the street, intending to order a
carriage at the inn, but luckily found the flyman
who had brought him from Great Yafford, refreshing
his horse with a nosebag and himself with a pint of
ale before a small beer-shop over against the churchyard.
He told this man to bring his fly close up to
the gate for a lady.</p>

<p>‘I must get back to the town directly,’ said the
man.</p>

<p>‘I only want you to drive half a mile or so, and
I’ll give you a crown for the job.’</p>

<p>‘Very well, sir, I’ll do it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span></p>

<p>Cyril went back to the spot where he had left
Beatrix. She was seated upon a low stone tomb,
supported by Mrs. Pomfret, and looking dazed and
white.</p>

<p>‘I have got a fly to drive her home,’ he said to
the pew-opener. ‘Bring her as soon as you can. It
is getting cold here.’</p>

<p>The wind had risen. The tall poplars were
swinging against the chill evening sky. The old yew
was groaning drearily, like a giant in pain.</p>

<p>Cyril waited silently, and as silently accompanied
Beatrix, when she was able to move slowly towards
the gate, leaning on Mrs. Pomfret as she went. He
handed her into the fly, with Mrs. Pomfret, who was
to see her safe at home, directed and paid the driver,
and waited bareheaded till the fly was out of sight.
A wild white face looked out at him from the carriage
window.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">KENRICK’S WEDDING DAY.</span></p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> evening after that meeting in the churchyard
was a melancholy one for Kenrick. He had
counted upon spending it with Beatrix. The settlements
were to have been signed at the Water
House at nine o’clock, the Vicar, Mr. Scratchell,
and Sir Kenrick meeting there for that purpose.
When nine o’clock came Sir Kenrick and the two
trustees were assembled in Miss Harefield’s drawing-room,
Mr. Scratchell’s clerk in attendance with the
documents, and ready to sign as witness whenever
required; but Miss Harefield herself was not forthcoming.
They waited some time, Sir Kenrick full
of uneasiness, and then Madame Leonard came to
them, looking pale and worried.</p>

<p>‘I am sorry to have bad news for you, Sir
Kenrick,’ she said, in her pretty French, ‘but Miss
Harefield is much too ill to sign any papers, or to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
see any one to-night. Is it absolutely necessary
these papers should be signed?’</p>

<p>‘They must be signed before she is married,’
said Mr. Scratchell, ‘but it can be done in the
vestry, five minutes before the wedding, if she
likes.’</p>

<p>‘But what is the matter?’ asked Sir Kenrick.
‘She was very well—or she seemed very well—when
I was with her yesterday.’</p>

<p>‘She is far from well to-night. She is nervous
and low-spirited. It would be cruelty to insist
upon her coming downstairs to receive you.’</p>

<p>‘I am not going to be cruel,’ said Kenrick,
moodily. ‘Perhaps it is cruel of me to ask her
to marry me to-morrow. Her low spirits to-night
seem to indicate that the prospect is repugnant
to her.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be savage, Kenrick,’ said the Vicar.
‘A young lady’s nerves are a delicate piece of
mechanism, and a trifle will put them out of
order. The settlements had better stand over till
to-morrow morning. We can all meet here at
ten.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span></p>

<p>‘But I want to know why she is ill, or out of
spirits,’ urged Kenrick. ‘Has Mr. Namby seen
her?’ he asked abruptly of Madame Leonard.</p>

<p>‘No. She is hardly so ill as to need medical
advice. She wants repose, to be left to herself for
a little while, not to be worried about business
matters. She wished to have no marriage settlement.
The whole thing is an annoyance to her.’</p>

<p>‘She wished to play the fool,’ muttered Mr.
Scratchell, ‘but I wasn’t going to let her make
ducks and drakes of the whole of her property.’</p>

<p>They all went away after a little more talk,
Kenrick in a bad temper. This was like his
welcome at Southampton, when, with a heart burning
with eager love, he had found only coldness
and restraint in his betrothed. She had been
kinder, and had even seemed happy in his society of
late; but there had been moments of coldness, days
on which she had been absent-minded and fitful.</p>

<p>‘I am a fool to love her as I do,’ he thought,
as he walked silently back to the Vicarage, while
Mr. Dulcimer chewed the cud of his afternoon
readings, and debated within himself the motive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
of Ovid’s exile—a favourite subject of meditation
with him, as being a key-note to the domestic
history of Augustus, and a social mystery upon
which a man might muse and argue for ever
without coming any nearer an absolute conclusion.</p>

<p>‘I am a fool to make myself miserable about
her,’ mused Kenrick. ‘Why cannot I think of
my marriage as a mere matter of convenience—the
salvation of a fine old estate—as other people do?’</p>

<p>The tea party at the Vicarage had not been
lively. Cyril looked ill, and had little to say for
himself.</p>

<p>‘You are overworked at Bridford,’ said the
Vicar, decisively. ‘The place is killing you. I
must have you back here, Cyril. There is quite
work enough to be done, and you may indulge in
your new-fangled ways as much as you like, for I
know you are too sensible to consider outward
fripperies an essential part of an earnest service.
You shall do what you like with the choir, and
have as many services at unearthly hours of the
morning as you please. But you shall not kill
yourself in that polluted town.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span></p>

<p>‘I am more useful there than I could ever be
here,’ urged Cyril.</p>

<p>‘But you will be no use anywhere when you
are dead. A living dog, you know, is of more
value in the world than a dead lion. If you go on
doing the lion’s work yonder you will soon be in
the condition of the dead lion, and of less use than
the most insignificant live dog. They would stuff
you and put you in a glass case, no doubt—or
rather they would subscribe for a handsome tablet
in the parish church, setting out your virtues—but
the tablet would be useful to no one.’</p>

<p>‘Your argument is forcible,’ said Cyril. ‘If I
find myself really breaking down at Bridford I
will ask you to let me come back to my work here.’</p>

<p>‘Be sure you do.’</p>

<p>The cousins were not alone together during
any part of the evening. It was between ten and
eleven o’clock when the Vicar and Kenrick returned
from the Water House, and they found Mrs.
Dulcimer alone in the library.</p>

<p>‘Poor Cyril was tired after his journey,’ she
said, ‘and I persuaded him to go to bed half an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
hour ago. Oh, Clement, I never saw such a change
in any young man. I’m afraid he’s going into a
decline.’</p>

<p>‘Fiddlesticks!’ exclaimed the Vicar. ‘There’s
nothing consumptive about the Culverhouses.
Cyril has the shoulders of an athlete, and the constitution
of a Spartan, reared at the public tables
on the leavings of the old men. But if he goes on
working night and day in the tainted air of Bridford,
he will get himself into such a feeble state that his
next attack of fever will be fatal.’</p>

<p>‘I am sure I had no idea he was so seriously
ill last September, or I should have gone to Bridford
to see him,’ said Mrs. Dulcimer, ‘but he tells me
he had excellent nurses, two Frenchwomen, sisters
of some charitable order. You needn’t be frightened,
Clement. They were not nuns; and they
made no attempt to convert him.’</p>

<p>‘I would not despise them if they had made
the attempt,’ answered the Vicar. ‘Every man has
a right to offer his idea of salvation to his brother.
The feeling is right, though the theology may be
wrong.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span></p>

<p>Kenrick was up soon after seven o’clock next
morning, a wintry gray morning, without a ray of
sunshine to gild his hopes. He was nearly dressed
when he was startled by the sharp voice of Rebecca.</p>

<p>‘A letter, sir, brought by hand from the Water
House. I’ve put it under the door.’</p>

<p>Kenrick seized the letter, with a vague foreboding
of evil. It was in Beatrix Harefield’s hand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘Forgive me, Kenrick, forgive me, if you can,
for what I am going to do. Oh, forgive me, my
poor friend, pray forgive me for having played
fast and loose with you. I am going away to
some corner of the world, where neither you nor
any one I have ever known can follow me or
hear of me. I am fleeing from a marriage which
could only result in misery to both you and me.
You love me too well, you are too generous-minded
to be satisfied with less than my true
love; and that I cannot give you. I have prayed
God to turn my heart towards you, to let me love
you, but I cannot. There is always another whose
image comes between me and my thoughts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
you. I have tried to forget him—to thrust him
out of my heart. I have tried to be angry with him
for his doubt of me, but once having given him
my heart I could not take it back again.</p>

<p>‘For the last few days my mind has been full
of hesitation and perplexity. I knew that if I
married you I should be doing a wicked thing—I
should stand before God’s altar with a lie upon
my lips. I knew that if I broke my promise I
should give you pain. I have argued the question
with myself a hundred times, but could come
to no fixed conclusion. I have been swayed to
and fro like a reed in the wind. I wanted to do
right, to act generously and justly to you who
have been so full of trustfulness and generosity
for me. This afternoon I saw your cousin. The
meeting was neither his seeking nor mine, Kenrick.
Be sure of that. An accident brought us
face to face in the churchyard. Oh, then I knew,
in a moment, that I must not marry you—that it
would be better to break a hundred promises
than to be your wife. Before he had spoken a
word, while he stood looking at me in silence, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
knew that I had never ceased to love him, that,
let him scorn me as he might, I must go on
loving him to the end.</p>

<p>‘So there was no alternative but this which I
am taking, and this letter is my last farewell to
you and all who have ever known me in England.</p>

<p>‘Your estate is free from the mortgage that
encumbered it. In the beginning of my trouble
of mind—when I found myself hesitating as to what
course I ought to take—I resolved that the home
you love should be set free. It is done. I beg
you to take this as a gift from one who has
learned to love you very truly as a friend and
brother, but who could never have loved you with
the love you would have claimed from a wife.</p>

<p class="center">
‘Yours affectionately and regretfully,<br />
‘<span class="smcap">Beatrix Harefield</span>.<br />
‘<i>The Water House, Tuesday, Eleven o’clock.</i>’
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘This is Cyril’s doing,’ cried Kenrick, beside
himself with rage. ‘They have plotted this between
them. And she throws her money in my
face. She thinks that I am so tame a hound as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
to take the wealth, for which the world would
say I chose her, and let her go—the money
without the wife. They have planned it between
them. It is like Cyril. “Kenrick only cares
about Culverhouse Castle,” he told her. “Set the
estate free, and he will forgive you all the rest.”
But I will not forgive either of them. I will follow
both with my undying hatred. I will fling back
her pitiful gift into her false face. She let me
think I had won her love, while she meant to
buy my forgiveness with her money.’</p>

<p>And then he flung himself face downward on
the floor, and gave vent to his passion in angry
tears. He had been happier lying on the blood-soaked
ground under the walls of Pegu, with the
brown Burmese soldiers trampling upon him, and
a very acute consciousness of a bullet in his
shoulder. Never had he been so wretched as at
this moment, never so angry with fate or his
fellow-men.</p>

<p>He had to conquer his passion presently, and
go calmly downstairs to tell Mr. and Mrs. Dulcimer
that there was to be no wedding.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">JILTED.</span></p>

<p class="noin">‘<span class="smcap">No</span> wedding!’ screamed Mrs. Dulcimer, putting
down the old silver teapot and staring aghast into
space.</p>

<p>‘No wedding?’ repeated the Vicar.</p>

<p>‘No,’ answered Kenrick, hoarsely, and with a
hardness of manner which he maintained all through
that painful day. ‘Beatrix has been fooling me all
this time. She has written to tell me that she
never loved me—and—at the last—it came into her
head that she ought not to marry me without loving
me. An afterthought. And she flings me fifty
thousand pounds as a peace-offering. As you throw
an importunate dog a biscuit, when you don’t want
him to follow you.’</p>

<p>‘It is most extraordinary,’ exclaimed the Vicar.
‘She was in such a hurry to pay off those mortgages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
before her marriage. I thought she was romantically
in love with you.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t understand,’ said Kenrick. ‘That
was how she meant to make amends to me. She
valued my love, my manhood, my self-respect at
fifty thousand pounds. I am paid in full, she thinks,
and I have no right to complain.’</p>

<p>‘Women are an inscrutable species,’ said the
Vicar.</p>

<p>‘I am a most unlucky woman,’ wailed Mrs.
Dulcimer. ‘I took such a pride in bringing Kenrick
and Beatrix together—such an excellent match—so
well suited to each other—a large fortune—a
fine position in the county—title—everything.’</p>

<p>‘My love, it will not mend the matter for you to
get hysterical,’ remonstrated the Vicar. ‘Where are
you going, Kenrick?’ he asked, as Kenrick moved
towards the door.</p>

<p>‘To the Water House. Where is Cyril?’</p>

<p>‘He got an early cup of tea from Rebecca, and
went round to see some of his old parishioners. He
promised to be at the church before eleven.’</p>

<p>‘A superfluous civility,’ said Kenrick. ‘No doubt
he knew there would be no wedding.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span></p>

<p>‘Kenrick,’ remonstrated Mrs. Dulcimer, but Kenrick
was gone.</p>

<p>He walked down to the Water House faster than
he had ever walked there in his life, though Love
had lent him Mercury’s winged sandals. To-day
rage and baffled love, and gnawing jealousy, drove
him as fast as if they had been palpable scourges
wielded by the Furies.</p>

<p>Everything looked very quiet at the old house by
the river. The butler came to the door. Miss Harefield
had gone away with Madame Leonard at six
o’clock that morning. The carriage had taken them
to the railway station at Great Yafford. No one
had gone with them but the coachman, and he had
not left his box. The porters had carried the luggage
into the station. Yes, there was a good deal of
luggage. The big cases were to be sent to a furniture
warehouse in London.</p>

<p>The house was to remain in the care of the butler,
and Mrs. Peters, the housekeeper. The servants
were to be on board wages. Mr. Scratchell was to
arrange everything.</p>

<p>Mr. Scratchell came in while Sir Kenrick was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
questioning the butler. He too had received a letter
from Beatrix, which he allowed Kenrick to read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Scratchell</span>,—I am going abroad,
most likely for a long time. Please receive the rents,
as usual, attend to all repairs, and pay in all moneys
to the bank, as heretofore. I shall be obliged if you
will give the servants whatever allowance is liberal
and proper for board wages. This had better be paid
monthly, in advance. Please see that the house and
grounds are kept in good order, and that all my
subscriptions to local and other charities are regularly
paid.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Dulcimer is to have any money he may
require for his poor.’</p>

<p class="center">
‘Yours very truly,<br />
‘<span class="smcap">Beatrix Harefield</span>.’
</p></blockquote>

<p>‘Business-like,’ said Mr. Scratchell, ‘but I’m
afraid the poor young woman is not quite right in
her mind. Do you know what she has done about
the mortgages on your property?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered Kenrick. ‘You don’t suppose I
am going to keep the money?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span></p>

<p>‘I don’t suppose you’d be so demented as to give
it back,’ said Mr. Scratchell. ‘You’d better keep it.
If she doesn’t make ducks and drakes of it one way,
she will another. What was your quarrel about?’</p>

<p>‘Quarrel,’ echoed Kenrick, and then it occurred
to him that it was just as well to let this vulgarian
Scratchell believe that he and Beatrix had quarrelled.</p>

<p>How could a piece of such common clay as Mr.
Scratchell comprehend the finer feelings of human
porcelain? He only thought it cracked.</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be discovered at the
Water House. Beatrix and her companion had gone.
That was all. Miss Harefield had made her arrangements
with coolness and promptitude. It might be
just possible to follow her. But to what end?</p>

<p>Kenrick went in quest of Cyril. After a good
deal of inquiry he found him with a bedridden old
woman, listening to a doleful story of the winter’s
sufferings.</p>

<p>‘I want to talk to you, Cyril,’ said Kenrick, and,
with a gentle apology, Cyril cut short the dame’s
rambling account of her bodily ills.</p>

<p>‘What is the matter, Ken?’ asked Cyril, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
they were outside in the windy road. ‘You look as
pale as a ghost.’</p>

<p>‘There is to be no marriage. Beatrix has gone
away—and you know all about it. You planned it
together yesterday when you met in the churchyard.’</p>

<p>‘Upon my honour, Kenrick, I know nothing,’
answered the other, solemnly.</p>

<p>‘Why should I believe you? She, whom I
thought the noblest of women, has fooled and jilted
me. In whose honour am I to believe after that?’</p>

<p>‘Kenrick, I am deeply sorry for you.’</p>

<p>‘Pray spare me that. Your pity would be the
last drop of gall in my cup. Will you swear to me
that you do not know where she is gone—that you
had nothing to do with her going?’</p>

<p>‘Directly, nothing,’ answered Cyril, very pale.</p>

<p>His conscience smote him for that scene of yesterday.
He had given the reins to passion, he, a man
who had hitherto shaped his life upon principle. He
felt himself guilty.</p>

<p>‘Directly, no. You are equivocating with me, as
only your virtuous man can equivocate. You are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
Pharisees, every one of you, straining at gnats and
swallowing camels. What about your indirect influence?
It was that which broke off my marriage.’</p>

<p>‘I met your betrothed wife yesterday, by accident.
I was taken off my guard. In the bewilderment of
that moment I may have said foolish things—’</p>

<p>‘Yes, you urged her to break off her marriage.
You left her a year ago, of your own accord. And
now, finding that I had won her, it came into your
head to try and take her away from me. A manly
course throughout.’</p>

<p>‘Kenrick, when I went away conscience was
my dictator. Yesterday I let passion master me.
I confess it with deepest humiliation. But trust
me, if Beatrix did not love you, it is better—infinitely
better—that you and she should be
parted for ever. No happiness would have come
out of your union——’</p>

<p>‘Preach your sermons to more patient listeners,’
cried Kenrick, savagely. ‘I will have none of them.’</p>

<p>And so the cousins parted. Kenrick went to
Great Yafford to make inquiries at the station, but
at that busy place there had been nobody with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
leisure enough to particularize two ladies—one
tall and the other short—going away by the seven
o’clock train. Neither Miss Harefield’s carriage
nor Miss Harefield’s person had made any impression
upon the mind of the porter who had carried
her luggage into the station.</p>

<p>There was a train that started for London at
seven, there was another that went northward at a
quarter past. There was the Liverpool train at 7.30.
She might have travelled by any one of these.</p>

<p>Kenrick went back to the Vicarage in a savage
humour. No good could have come from the pursuit
of his lost bride, but it was hard not to know
where she had gone. Fortunately Cyril passed him
unawares on the road between the town and the
village, so those two did not meet again.</p>

<p>‘I shall go to London to-morrow,’ Kenrick told
the Dulcimers that evening, ‘and present myself at
the War Office next day.’</p>

<p>‘You want to go back to India directly?’ asked
the Vicar.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I shall cut short my leave by a month
or six weeks.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span></p>

<p>‘Dear Kenrick, why not stop with us till you
recover your spirits after this cruel blow?’ urged
Mrs. Dulcimer.</p>

<p>‘My kindest of friends, I could never recover
my spirits at Little Yafford. Forgive me for saying
so, but the place has become hateful to me. Even
your kindness could not make it endurable.’</p>

<p>‘Kenrick is right,’ said the Vicar. ‘He has
been very badly treated, and his profession will
be his best consolation.’</p>

<p>‘There is one thing that must be settled before
I go back to India,’ said Kenrick. ‘I must give—Miss
Harefield—back her money. I cannot
carry that burden away with me. You are her
guardian and one of her trustees, Vicar. You and
Mr. Scratchell must manage the business between
you. I can only raise the money by a new mortgage.
Would it not be best for Miss Harefield’s
trustees to take a mortgage on my estate for the
amount they have advanced? I paid the other
people only four per cent. I might pay her five.’</p>

<p>‘I do not think she will take a mortgage. I
do not believe she will take her money back in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
any form whatsoever,’ said the Vicar. ‘She has
written me a letter, which I shall show you when
you are calmer and more disposed to forgiveness.
It is a very touching letter, full of truth and
generous feeling. She has treated you very badly—she
has been foolish, mistaken; but she is a
noble girl, and she is much to be pitied. You
will be ungenerous if you insist on giving her
back the money. She has more than enough without
it.’</p>

<p>‘I shall be a mean hound if I keep it,’ said
Kenrick.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">MRS. PIPER’S DAY.</span></p>

<p class="noin">‘I <span class="smcap">am</span> not surprised,’ said Miss Coyle, when she was
informed that Beatrix Harefield had gone away, and
there was to be no wedding. ‘That unhappy young
woman’s guilty conscience has driven her away. A
just punishment for Sir Kenrick. Of course he was
going to marry her for her money. He knows, as
well as I do, that she poisoned her father.’</p>

<p>The wedding was to have been strictly private—altogether
different from the imposing ceremonial
that had made Bella Scratchell the second Mrs.
Piper. There were no guests to be put off at the
last moment; there was no confusion anywhere; but
there was a great deal of talk in Little Yafford when
it became generally known, through Mrs. Pomfret,
the pew-opener, that Sir Kenrick’s marriage was not
to be.</p>

<p>There were various theories as to Beatrix Harefield’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
motive for her extraordinary conduct. ‘Guilty
conscience,’ said Miss Coyle and her party. ‘A prior
attachment,’ said the more charitably inclined. ‘The
girl must be wrong in her head,’ said the matter-of-fact
matrons and middle-aged husbands, who could
not understand the fits and starts of passion.</p>

<p>Perhaps in all the neighbourhood there was only
one person, except the rival cousins themselves, who
guessed the real cause of Miss Harefield’s flight.
That person was Mrs. Piper. She knew how deeply
Beatrix had loved Cyril, and it hardly surprised her
that, at the last moment, she should refuse to consummate
a loveless bond.</p>

<p>‘It might have been happier for me if I had run
away,’ thought Bella, looking round her apple-green
dressing-room, with all the gewgaws Mr. Piper’s
generosity had heaped upon her, ‘yet any other life
than this would be almost unbearable now.’</p>

<p>Time went on. Kenrick returned to India,
leaving his honour in Mr. Dulcimer’s hands. Miss
Harefield’s money was to be paid back, and without
loss of time. Kenrick’s lawyers and Mr. Dulcimer
were to arrange the matter between them somehow;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
Kenrick did not care how; but the thing must be done.
On that point Sir Kenrick was firmly resolved.</p>

<p>The lawyers were as slow as most of their craft,
and saw no reason why such a business as this
should be precipitated. Mr. Dulcimer was the last
man to hasten the movements of the lawyers.
Happy in his world of shadows—now digging out
the forgotten temples of Nineveh and Babylon—anon
wandering with the lost tribes of Israel—he
was apt to let the actual business of life slip out of
his mind altogether. Mrs. Dulcimer had to remind
him of everything, to tell him what bills he ought to
pay, what people he ought to visit—all the details of
his quiet life. Now Mrs. Dulcimer was not disposed
to remind her husband of Kenrick’s desire to refund
Miss Harefield’s fifty thousand pounds. She hoped
that Kenrick might, by fair means or foul, be made
to keep the money. He had been cruelly wronged.
The least atonement that could be made to him was
the liberation of his estate from its old burdens.
Thus argued Mrs. Dulcimer, while Kenrick was
busy fighting the Burmese.</p>

<p>Before the bleak winds of March had ceased to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
blow their keenest across the wide waste of withered
heather and sandy barrenness, before the last of the
daffodils had faded in Mrs. Pomfret’s neat garden,
Cyril Culverhouse had come back to his old place at
Little Yafford. He had done good work at Bridford,
but the work had been too much for him. He could
not be content to do half the work wanted, and leave
the rest undone. Another man in his position would
have been easy in his conscience after doing a quarter
of the good that Cyril had done in that crowded
lazar-house; but the knowledge of unconquerable
evils, of cures only half wrought, weighed upon Cyril’s
spirits like an ever-present nightmare. He could not
sleep for the thought of the evils round about him—the
loathsome miseries—the rampant vices—the
selfishness of the rich—the godlessness of the poor.
His health broke down under the burden. This time
it was no fierce attack of fever—no brain sickness
and delirium,—but his strength went down like the
sand in a glass when the hour is nearly done—appetite
failed—the power of sleep left him, and Dr.
Bolling told him, in plainest terms, that if he wished
to go on living he must leave Bridford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span></p>

<p>Brought face to face with this solemn question of
life or death, Cyril discovered that existence was not
altogether worthless. He, who a little time ago had
courted death, had now no desire to die. There were
mysteries that he wanted to solve in this life, before
he went to investigate the awful mystery beyond it.
He wanted to stand face to face with Beatrix Harefield
once more. He wanted to know whether it was
indeed for love of him she had at the last moment
jilted his cousin. He wanted to find some stronger
proof of her innocence than the sudden conviction
that had flashed into his mind when he looked into her
steadfast eyes, and saw scorn of his weak doubts, and
fondest love for himself, at war in her soul. While
he lived there was always a chance, however remote,
of his discovering the truth. While he lived there
was always the possibility that Beatrix and he might
meet. She was not his cousin’s wife. Fate had
spared him that last bitterness. He could think of
her without sin.</p>

<p>So he came back to Little Yafford, to his old
rooms, his old friends, his old ways, and the old
quietly busy life which seemed so easy after his vain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
endeavour to cleanse that Augean stable, an overcrowded
manufacturing town.</p>

<p>‘I never feel as if I had too much work to do, so
long as it is work that can be done,’ he said to the
gentle Vicar. ‘To grapple with impossibilities and
feel one’s self being daily worsted! That is the trial.’</p>

<p>There were two of his parishioners at Bridford
whom Cyril could not be content to leave behind
him. Those were Emmanuel Joyce and his mother.
Emmanuel’s gratitude for the man who had risked
his life to save him had done what argument and
teaching might never have accomplished. Emmanuel
was now a conscientious conforming Christian. He
believed, as the leper believed, because he had been
saved. The conduct of one Christian man opened
his heart to receive the sublime mystery of a Redeemer
who was more than man. He went to the
altar without one lurking doubt. He made himself
like a little child, and confessed that all the learning
he had been so proud of was nothing, when weighed
against his friend and teacher’s one act of Christian
self-abnegation.</p>

<p>‘What was I that you should sacrifice yourself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
for me?’ he said. ‘When man can be so generous
I will no longer refuse to believe that God can suffer
and die for sinners.’</p>

<p>‘I would have you believe upon better grounds
than any friendly act of mine,’ said Cyril.</p>

<p>‘I have been face to face with death,’ answered
Joyce. ‘Men learn strange things on their deathbeds.
A death-bed repentance may be a poor thing,
but a death-bed revelation may accomplish what a
life of study could not do.’</p>

<p>And then Emmanuel, being by nature an enthusiast,
talked wildly of the visions of his bed of pain—the
cloud-curtain that had been lifted from the
invisible world—the wonders that he had seen and
heard in that mysterious border-land between life
and death.</p>

<p>Cyril asked no more than a simple unquestioning
belief.</p>

<p>It was with a thrill of joy that he saw Emmanuel
kneeling before the altar rails, meekly lifting up his
hands to receive the sacred symbols of Divine love.
Could he leave his convert behind him in the fever-tainted
alley, where the sweet summertide was ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
the harbinger of death? No. He made up his mind
that Emmanuel and his mother should go with him.</p>

<p>‘I am doubtful if you would be able to live at
Little Yafford by shoe-mending,’ he said, when he
discussed the question with Joyce and the widow,
‘but, if I could get the schoolmaster a better berth
somewhere else, I am sure you could manage the
school, with a little help from me at the beginning.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, sir, it would be the very thing for him,’
cried Mrs. Joyce. ‘His father began life as a parish
schoolmaster, and he gave Emmanuel a good plain
education. He was very severe with the poor lad,
but that was partly in his anxiety to make him a
thorough scholar. I don’t think there’s any one
could beat my boy in arithmetic or Bible history.
I’m sure he could teach. You’d like to teach,
wouldn’t you, Emmanuel?’</p>

<p>‘John Milton was a schoolmaster,’ said Joyce,
with his face all aglow. ‘I should like it of all
things, if you think I could do it, Mr. Culverhouse.’</p>

<p>‘As for book learning,’ cried the widow, ‘I don’t
think there’s one in a thousand—no, not even among
the gentlefolks—has read as much as my Emmanuel.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span></p>

<p>‘A wide range of reading would hardly be required,
though every teacher must be the better for it,’ said
Cyril, smiling. ‘But I know that Emmanuel has
been well grounded in a plain English education,
and that he now thinks rightly upon religious questions,
so I fancy he might teach well in our parish
school. Of course, the first thing to be done is to get
a better place for the present man, who is a very
good master.’</p>

<p>Cyril did not add, as he might have done, that
the present schoolmaster’s merits were chiefly his
work. He had taken infinite pains to teach the
teacher as well as the pupils.</p>

<p>Before Cyril had been at Little Yafford a month
he contrived to get the schoolmaster transferred to a
more profitable situation forty miles away, and to get
Emmanuel Joyce accepted as master upon probation.
He was to do the work for a quarter without remuneration;
and if he succeeded in pleasing the
Vicar and churchwardens, was to be engaged at the
end of that time at the handsome stipend of five-and-thirty
pounds a year, with a cottage adjoining the
school, and an allowance of coals and candles. This,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
in Yorkshire twenty years ago was to be passing
rich.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible to conceive greater happiness
than that of Mrs. Joyce and her son when they
came to take possession of their cottage at Little
Yafford. The rustic beauty of the village, the
grandeur of the moor, the blue river winding capriciously
through the valley, the dark pine branches
gently swaying in the April breeze, the gardens bright
with spring flowers, the silvery blackthorn in the
hedges, the primroses and dog-violets, the scattered
houses, all more or less picturesque of aspect, the
sloping meadows, and orchards full of pear blossom—all
these things, to people who had lived in one of
the most loathsome corners of a manufacturing town,
were as a revelation of an earthly paradise. Could
heaven itself be sweeter or fairer? Could death ever
enter here? Mrs. Joyce wondered. Was there any
coffin-maker in that peaceful village? The thread
of life, spun gently in this fair tranquillity, must
surely run on for ever. What should snap it?</p>

<p>The four-roomed cottage seemed to the Joyces
the most luxurious mansion. Four rooms! What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
could they two possibly do with such a world of
space? There would be room enough for ghosts
in the unused chambers. And then Mrs. Joyce
reminded her son how, before illness crippled his
father, and brought poverty and trouble, they had
lived in a four-roomed house just like this, with a
scullery at the back of the kitchen, which might be
accounted a fifth room, and a little yard where
they were able to grow scarlet runners.</p>

<p>‘It is like old times, Emmanuel, when your
father was earning his five-and-thirty shillings a
week,’ said Mrs. Joyce, ‘and my house was the
neatest and brightest in Saville’s Buildings.’</p>

<p>‘Wherever you lived, mother, the place would
be neat and bright,’ said her son, admiringly.</p>

<p>They went out to explore the garden, enraptured
with everything. It was quite an extensive garden,
nearly a quarter of an acre. There were potatoes,
and apple trees, and gooseberry and currant bushes,
and roses in abundance. And there was room for
scarlet runners, as Mrs. Joyce exclaimed delightedly.</p>

<p>The scarlet runner is the chief of vegetables in
the estimation of the poor. That homely, useful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
bean will grow anywhere, and is a thing of beauty
wherever it grows.</p>

<p>‘We might even try some vegetable marrows,
Emmanuel,’ said the widow. ‘They would look so
pretty behind the rose bushes in summer-time.’</p>

<p>Emmanuel began his work next day, after a long
conversation with Mr. Culverhouse overnight. Cyril
was going to allow him ten shillings a week during
his time of probation. It was very little, perhaps,
but the frugal widow could manage to make it serve,
and it was a great deal for Cyril to give out of his
small means.</p>

<p>Before a week was ended everybody concerned
was agreed that Emmanuel would do. The children
liked their new master. There was something in
his quiet manner which won both liking and respect.
It was thought that he knew a great deal. He
had taken the trouble to explain things to his
pupils. He had enlarged upon the meagre history
of England, in which the kings and heroes, politicians
and Churchmen, were the merest shadows,
and had told the boys of the greatness and power
that had been in their native land since Alfred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
the Saxon, warrior and poet, kindled the light of
letters amongst a barbarous people. The more intelligent
of the boys were delighted with him—even
the stupid ones brightened under his tuition.
He was so keenly interested in his work. The
pupils could hardly find their lessons a burden,
when the master took so much pleasure in them.</p>

<p>On Sunday he sat at the end of the church,
with his pupils ranged before him on a row of
benches beside the organ.</p>

<p>He kept them in wonderful order, and the
occasional dropping of marbles and attacks of
spasmodic coughing which had been apt to disturb
the congregation under the rule of Emmanuel’s
predecessor were no longer heard.</p>

<p>Cyril was delighted at the success of his scheme.
The Vicar and churchwardens did not wait for
the three months of probation to come to an end,
before they expressed their satisfaction. At midsummer,
Emmanuel Joyce was formally appointed
schoolmaster, and his salary began from that time.
The school-house was beautifully kept by Mrs.
Joyce; the cottage and garden were a picture of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
neatness, unsurpassed by any house or garden in
Little Yafford. Cyril had the deep delight of
knowing that he had made two people happy.</p>

<p>His own life went on very quietly all this time.
He was certainly happier at Little Yafford than
he ever could have been at Bridford. He had
plenty to do, and his work was successful. He
saw the church crowded on a Sunday evening,
and knew that people came from far and wide to
hear him preach. Had he been vain of his power
as a preacher his vanity might have been fully
satisfied. The week-day services were well
attended. The people led better lives than when
he had first come among them. There was less
drunkenness, there were fewer brawls. Over the
young people his influence was powerful. He
gave a more intellectual tone to their lives. He
had opened a reading-room, which was now a self-supporting
and self-governing institution, but its
committee always looked to him for advice in the
choice of books.</p>

<p>He saw a good deal of the Dulcimers, in his
occasional leisure hours, and with the kind and genial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Vicar he was always happy. The keenest pang that
he felt in all his sad memories of the past was when
he passed the Water House, and saw its darkened
windows, and remembered that she who should have
reigned there as a centre of light and happiness was
a wanderer none knew where, her fair fame clouded,
her youth blighted.</p>

<p>He called once in a way on Mrs. Piper of the
Park; not often, for the thought of Bella had never
been entirely agreeable to him after that conversation
with Mrs. Dulcimer, in which he had, in a manner,
found himself accused of having misled the young
lady—or at any rate the young lady’s friends—as to
his intentions. Now that she was married he had
certainly no need to be uneasy on that score; but the
recollection was an uncomfortable one, and he had a
feeling about Mrs. Piper much too near dislike to be
altogether Christian.</p>

<p>Bella, in all the fulness of her new powers, was
not a person to be easily kept at a distance. She
wanted captives at her chariot wheels, to make her
triumph complete, and she was particularly anxious
that Cyril Culverhouse—who, according to her own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
idea, had scorned her in her poverty—should see and
wonder at her splendour and elegance. She pestered
him with invitations, all of which he found it impossible
to decline without marked discourtesy, more
especially as Mr. and Mrs. Piper were regular worshippers
at the parish church, and liberal subscribers
to all local charities.</p>

<p>Bella had taken it into her head to receive her
friends upon one particular day of the week. It was
quite a new thing in Little Yafford—except for such
a person as Lady Jane Gowry, who was a privileged
eccentric—and had rather a foreign flavour. At the
beginning of this institution visitors were slow to
arrive, and Bella found it rather a dull business to
sit waiting for them, looking her loveliest, in a dress
just arrived from Paris, but with nobody but Mr.
Piper to admire her.</p>

<p>‘You look uncommon pretty, my dear,’ said that
devoted husband, walking up and down his blue and
gold drawing-room, as restlessly as a polar bear in his
cage, ‘but I can’t say that I hold with this new style
of visiting. If you was to ask people to a jolly good
dinner they’d be sure to come; if you asked them to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
friendly tea, I dare say they’d come, though they
might think it low. But you send ’em your pasteboard
with “Mrs. Piper, Thursdays, At home from
four to six,” and I’ll lay they don’t know what to
make of it.’</p>

<p>‘It’s quite the right thing, Mr. Piper. In London
everybody of any importance does it. And here,
where the distances people have to come are so much
longer, it is still more convenient.’</p>

<p>‘Then I suppose you’re not of any importance,
my dear,’ said the provoking Mr. Piper, ‘for you see
nobody comes.’</p>

<p>‘How can you say so, Mr. Piper,’ cried Bella,
reddening with anger at this obnoxious truth. ‘Miss
Coyle came last Thursday.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, and the Thursday before that, and the
Thursday before that again. That old lady will come
anywhere for the sake of a dish of scandal and a cup
of strong tea.’</p>

<p>‘And Mrs. Dulcimer comes.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I believe she has been once,’ said Mr. Piper,
and then, anxious to chase the thunder-cloud from
his young wife’s stormy brow, he added hastily,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
‘Never mind, my lass. You’ll have a visitor this
afternoon. I met Chumney this morning when I
was in Great Yafford, and I asked him to drop in at
five and pay his respects to you, and eat his chop
with me at seven.’</p>

<p>‘What!’ cried Bella, ‘you have invited that vulgarian,
your old cashier! Mr. Piper, I am ashamed
of you. You have not a particle of self-respect.’</p>

<p>‘Why, what’s amiss with Chumney? The most
faithful servant a man ever had. Why should I cast
him off because I’ve got a pretty young wife? The
first Mrs. P. never made any objection to Chumney.
She never said a word about the difference in the
butcher’s bill, let me bring him home as often as I
might. Why should you object to him?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t object to him, as a faithful servant, but
let him be kept in a servant’s place. Why bring him
home here—a man who eats peas with his knife, and
bites his bread, and is always talking of the time
when you were in trade. Can’t you see that I am
trying to raise the tone of your surroundings——’</p>

<p>‘The tone be blowed,’ muttered Mr. Piper.</p>

<p>‘That I want to get you recognised by the county<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
people; that I want to force you into the best
society in the neighbourhood. You must know this,
and yet you bring Chumney to spoil everything. He
was at our last dinner party.’</p>

<p>‘Well, he did no harm,’ growled Mr. Piper, waxing
savage.</p>

<p>‘He was an eyesore. He was a blot upon the
whole thing. Do you think I shall ever rise above
your Wigzells and your Porkmans, while you weigh
me down with Mr. Chumney?’</p>

<p>‘My Wigzells and my Porkmans are a deal pleasanter
than the stuck-up lot <i>you’ve</i> contrived to bring
about me,’ retorted Mr. Piper, ‘A pack of shabby-genteel
lawyers and parsons and half-pay captains,
that eat up my substance and stare me out of countenance,
as if I was waxwork—and never offer me bite
nor sup in return. I despise such half-and-half
gentry. I’d as soon put electro-plated goods on my
table as set them down to it. And as for the county,’
cried Mr. Piper, snapping his fingers derisively, ‘the
county won’t have cut, shuffle, or deal with us, and
wouldn’t, no, not if you were to put your eyes out
upon sticks.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span></p>

<p>This horrible expression, which Mr. Piper sometimes
used when he was in a passion, overcame
Bella. She began to cry, and murmured meekly
that she wouldn’t so much mind Mr. Chumney
coming if it was not her ‘day.’</p>

<p>‘Your day!’ cried Mr. Piper, growing bold in
his scorn. ‘Your day, be hanged! Nobody comes
on your day. You might as well call it Queen
Elizabeth’s day, or Nebuchadnezzar’s day. You’ve
laid yourself out to know a parcel of arrogant people
that don’t want to know you, and you’ve turned
up your nose at people that give three hundred
guineas for a pair of horses, and live in handsome
houses of their own building, and brag about the
money they have earned with their own industry,
instead of bragging about their great-grandfathers.
You want to keep company with the Tudors and
the Plantagenets. Nothing less than that will
satisfy you. But they won’t have you, and if
you want any one to admire your fine clothes and
eat your fine dinners you’d better be content with
my friends.’</p>

<p>Mr. Chumney’s arrival brought the conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
to an abrupt finish. He was a long lean
man, with iron-gray hair and whiskers, thick black
eyebrows, and an intelligent expression which
atoned in some measure for his gaunt ugliness.</p>

<p>He loved Ebenezer Piper with the affection of
a faithful dog that has never known but one
master, and with regard to all the rest of the
world he was strictly misanthropic. He was not
a scandalmonger like Miss Coyle. He generally
thought the worst of people, but he always kept
his thoughts to himself. He believed every business
man, except Mr. Piper, to be an innate rogue, and
on the verge of insolvency, but he gave no expression
to his doubts. He was not a lively companion,
so far as conversation goes, but he was an accomplished
listener; he had the art of looking ineffably
wise, and of appearing to be able to give an immense
deal of information, if he had not preferred
to withhold it. He was like the great Lord
Thurlow. Nobody ever could have been so wise
as Samuel Chumney looked.</p>

<p>From the hour she became acquainted with
Mr. Chumney Bella had hated him. She did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
know why. It might have been his eyebrows, it
might have been his vulgarity. For some undiscovered
reason he was more obnoxious to her than
any creature she had ever met. She thought him
clever, and she had a lurking idea that he was
able to read her as easily as he could read a book.
She fancied that he knew everything that was
passing in her mind—that he was perfectly familiar
with her motive for marrying his old employer—that
he had weighed and measured her till he
was master of her most secret thoughts. She lectured
her husband for his cultivation of Chumney;
but she was wonderfully polite to Mr. Chumney
himself. She feared him too much to be discourteous
to him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">CAPTAIN STANDISH.</span></p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Whether</span> it was that Mr. Piper’s plain speaking
had its effect, or that Bella grew wise by experience,
is an open question; but soon after the particular
Thursday upon which Mr. Chumney appeared as
an unwelcome guest, the second Mrs. Piper
changed her tactics altogether. She left off besieging
the county people in their impregnable fortresses,
surrounded with the moat of exclusiveness, and
shut in with the portcullis of pride. She dropped
a good many of those ultra-genteel professional
people against whose impertinence Mr. Piper had
protested, and she opened her house freely to her
husband’s commercial allies of the past—<span class="err" title="original: the Wigzell's">the Wigzells</span>,
the Porkmans, the Timperleys, and a good
many more of the same class.</p>

<p>When she had made these people understand
that her Thursday afternoon reception meant something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
lively and sociable she was no longer without
visitors. The midsummer weather suggested a tent
on the lawn, where tea and claret cup, and strawberries
and cream, might be taken amidst the perfume of
roses and warbling of blackbirds. Archery was introduced
on the long stretch of grass on the other
side of the ha-ha. Mr. Piper insisted on having
American bowls for himself and his particular
friends, in an old-fashioned garden on one side of
the big square mansion, comfortably shut in by
a dense holly hedge, a retreat where a man might
smoke a clay pipe and be vulgar at his ease.</p>

<p>The Wigzells and their compeers all came in
handsome carriages, and, if the men were somewhat
given to eccentricity in their hats and collars,
the women all dressed in the latest fashion. But their
highest claim to Bella’s favour was the fact that
they brought very pleasant people in their train;
officers in the regiment stationed at Great Yafford,
clever young barristers, lawyers of higher standing
than the starched solicitors who had retired to
cultivate their roses and air their self-importance
in the pastoral seclusion of Little Yafford. Bella<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
perceived with delight that even these manufacturing
people could be useful to her.</p>

<p>By midsummer, Mrs. Piper’s Thursday afternoons,
which had at first been such dire failures
as to provoke the sarcasms of Miss Coyle and her
set, had become so successful that Miss Coyle now
found herself a neglected atom in the crowd, and
sat apart with one of her chosen friends, breathing
condemnations of this new phase of worldliness
and frivolity. Miss Coyle liked the strong tea,
and unlimited pound cake, the claret cup, and
strawberries and cream, and better still did she
like the large opportunity for scandal which these
gatherings afforded her.</p>

<p>‘Poor dear Mrs. Piper,’ she sighed, meaning
the lady reposing under the sumptuous monument
of many-coloured marbles. ‘If she could only
come back to earth for an afternoon, and look upon
this scene! If!’</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ echoed Miss Coyle’s friend, Mrs. Namby,
the doctor’s wife, ‘if indeed! She would be surprised,
poor dear, wouldn’t she?’</p>

<p>‘To think of the waste going on in the servants’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
hall, now, my dear!’ continued Miss Coyle, with
the tone of a Hebrew prophet bewailing the follies
of his misguided nation. ‘It was bad enough in
the first Mrs. Piper’s time, though there never was
a more careful housekeeper. I’ve heard her lament
it many a day. <span class="smcap">What</span> must it be <span class="allsmcap">NOW</span>?’</p>

<p>Miss Coyle opened her eyes very wide as she
uttered this awful question, and poor little Mrs.
Namby, who always agreed with everybody, but
wished harm to nobody, opened hers in sympathy.</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ she sighed. ‘She’s very young, isn’t she?
You can’t expect much carefulness from such a
pretty young thing as that.’</p>

<p>‘Pretty young thing, indeed,’ cried Miss Coyle,
contemptuously. ‘We’ve all been pretty young
things in our day.’ This was an assertion which,
taken in conjunction with Miss Coyle’s present
physiognomy, was rather difficult to believe. ‘But
did that absolve us from doing our duty? Would
that have excused us if we’d been given over to dress,
and dissipation, and——’ here Miss Coyle made a
long and solemn pause——‘<span class="allsmcap">FLIRTATION</span>?’</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ cried poor Mrs. Namby, almost jumping off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
her garden chair, ‘pray don’t say that. I hope
Mrs. Piper has too much respect for herself as a
young married woman to be guilty of flirtation.’</p>

<p>‘I say nothing,’ replied Miss Coyle. ‘Look at
that, and judge for yourself, Mrs. Namby.’</p>

<p>‘That’ was as pretty a living picture of light-hearted
youth as a painter of modern manners need
have cared to paint. Against the green background
of beech boughs, bright with their midsummer shoots,
upon a carpet of velvet sward, stood two figures
apart from the rest of the revellers—a man in gray,
tall, well made, good-looking; a woman in an archery
dress of Lincoln green, setting off a form slight and
delicate enough for one of Diana’s nymphs, a hat and
feather, <i>à la</i> Rosalind, poised lightly on her burnished
auburn hair, neat little hands in tan gauntlets, and
a tall bow that became her as a fan becomes an
Andalusian.</p>

<p>The man in gray was Captain Standish, the crack
captain in the crack regiment then stationed at Great
Yafford. The regiment considered itself a great deal
too good for Great Yafford, and the captain considered
himself too good for the regiment. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
a man of good family; he had large means, a handsome
face, and a fine figure; he had come off first in
all athletic exercises at school and college; he had
not learnt anything else in particular—or in his own
words he had not ‘gone in for’ anything else; he left
it to be inferred that he could have taken honours
had he so chosen.</p>

<p>The lady in Lincoln green was Mrs. Piper the
second. She had instituted these archery meetings
for her own pleasure as well as that of her friends,
but she had not yet learned to hit the gold. The
three tall Miss Porkmans had been beating her
ignominiously in this afternoon’s contest. Captain
Standish had taken her in hand, and was giving her
a lesson in the management of her bow.</p>

<p>‘Well, really now I can’t see any harm,’ said
Mrs. Namby. ‘He’s giving her a lesson, don’t you
see? She’s a poor hand with a bow and arrows.’</p>

<p>Miss Coyle gave a prolonged sniff.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Piper may approve of such goings on,’ she
said. ‘I don’t think I should, if I were in his place.
Look at him bending down to speak to her, and look
at her, giggling and blushing like a silly school girl.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
If you don’t call <i>that</i> flirting the word must have a
different meaning from what it had in <i>my</i> time.’</p>

<p>The jerk of Miss Coyle’s bonnet seemed to imply
that she had done her share of flirting in the days
that were no more, and was an acute judge of such
matters.</p>

<p>Mrs. Namby looked at her with awe, marvelling
what valiant knight of an extinct chivalry could ever
have had the courage to flirt with Miss Coyle.</p>

<p>‘You really must let me ride over some morning
and give you a good long lesson. It excruciates me
to see those three Porkman Gorgons getting the best
of it in this way.’</p>

<p>That was what Captain Standish was bending
down to say, with that air of grave reverence which
from the distance looked tender. He was not
brilliant in conversation. His talent had all gone
into field sports and manly accomplishments, from
foxhunting, hammer-throwing, cricket, billiards—down
to skittles. He could give any man odds at all
these. It was astonishing what respect he won from
his fellow-men on account of this gift. Had he been
a second Newton or Herschel, he could not have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
carried things with a higher hand, or more keenly
felt his superiority to the ruck of mankind.</p>

<p>Then, again, he had that calm sense of ascendency
which distinguishes the man who has never been in
want of money. You can see it in his looks. There
is the tranquil arrogance of a being who has never
shivered at the rap of a dun, or quailed at opening
a lawyer’s letter, or been politely reminded by his
banker that his account is overdrawn.</p>

<p>‘You must really allow me to teach you,’ pleaded
Captain Standish. ‘I used to win prizes at this kind
of thing when I was a lad.’</p>

<p>His words were humble enough, but his tone
meant, ‘You ought to be intensely grateful for my
condescension in offering you such a privilege.’</p>

<p>It was Captain Standish’s first appearance at
Little Yafford Park, and Bella was fluttered by the
triumph of getting him there—at last. His brother
officers had come very often, from the blue-nosed
colonel to the callow cornets, and had eaten and
drunken and been jolly with Mr. Piper, and voted the
whole establishment ‘capital fun.’ But Captain
Standish was a different order of being, and never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
went anywhere till he had made people sensible of
his importance and exclusiveness, by holding himself
aloof. The Miss Porkmans and the Miss Wigzells
were rarely seen without one of the callow
cornets in their train. Mr. Porkman was on the
most familiar terms with Colonel O’Shaughnessy, the
blue-nosed commanding officer, who liked the Porkman
cellar and the Porkman cook, and was not too
refined to tolerate the Porkmans themselves. But
Captain Standish was not to be had so easily.
Cooks and cellars were indifferent to him. He
affected a Spartan simplicity in his diet—drank only
the driest champagne, and that seldom—dined on a
slice of mutton and a tumbler of Vichy water,
frankly avowed his abhorrence of provincial dinner
parties, refused five invitations out of six, and, after
accepting the sixth, disappointed his host at the
eleventh hour. Can it be wondered that, in a society
of newly rich provincials, Captain Standish was
eminently popular?</p>

<p>His dog-cart, severely painted darkest olive, black
harness, no plating, high-stepping brown horse, neat
groom in olive livery, and unexceptionable boots,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
plain black hat and cockade, made a sensation
whenever it appeared in the High Street, or flashed
meteor-like past the broad plate glass windows of
the villas on the London road.</p>

<p>Bella had heard of Captain Standish, both from
his brother officers and from the outside world, until
she knew his excellences and accomplishments by
heart. She was inspired with the same desire to
cultivate his acquaintance which agitated feminine
society in the brand-new Granges, Moats, and
Manors round Great Yafford. The Porkmans had
met him at a fancy ball, where he had stood out from
the tinselled King Charleses, and the spangled
Black Princes, and the theatrical brigands and
troubadours, in the actual dress of a Spanish bullfighter.
He had once accepted an invitation to dine
at the Porkmans’, had disappointed them at the last
moment, and had called a week after. The Miss
Porkmans had forgiven the ungracious disappointment
on account of the gracious call.</p>

<p>‘He looks lovely in morning dress,’ said Blanche
Porkman, who was youthful and enthusiastic. ‘If
you knew him you would rave about him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span></p>

<p>‘I never rave about people,’ returned Bella, with
dignity. ‘And I don’t in the least care about
knowing this Captain Standish.’</p>

<p>‘This Captain Standish!’ echoed Blanche Porkman,
indignantly. ‘You needn’t put a demonstrative
pronoun before him, Mrs. Piper. There’s nobody
else like him.’</p>

<p>In spite of her affected indifference, Bella was
bent upon bringing Captain Standish to the Park.
He had called upon the Porkmans. Was she—with
her advanced ideas of elegance and her unlimited capacity
for reading French novels—to be of less account
than the Porkmans? Was that overgrown Blanche,
with her drab hair and complexion, and goggle eyes,
to boast of an acquaintance beyond Bella’s reach?</p>

<p>‘The next time you come, colonel, you must
bring Captain Standish,’ said Mrs. Piper to the
cordial O’Shaughnessy, after that gentleman had
dined copiously at Mr. Piper’s expense, and told all
his tiger stories, in which he was apt to lose the
tiger in a jumble of irrelevant parentheses.</p>

<p>‘Madam, if I live and he lives till next Thursday,
Standish shall do homage at the shrine of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
beauty and domestic excellence,’ protested the
colonel, which was merely his way of saying that
Captain Standish should come to see Mrs. Piper.</p>

<p>The following Thursday came, but no Standish.
Another and another Thursday, and the colonel still
appeared, apologetic and disgusted. That fellow
Standish was perfectly incorrigible, he declared.
But this was the fourth Thursday, and Captain
Standish was here.</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ said the colonel, introducing his
junior, ‘I have kept my promise. If this fellow had
tried to put me off to-day I should have lugged him
here by the hair of his head.’</p>

<p>‘And if I had known how charming—a place I
was to see, I should have come ages ago without
your interference, colonel,’ said the captain.</p>

<p>There was a break in the sentence, a look in the
captain’s eyes that said in plainest language, ‘If I
had known what a lovely woman I was to see, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.’ And Bella, having lately graduated in the
novels of Charles de Bernard, thoroughly understood
the look and tone.</p>

<p>Mr. Piper also was gratified by Captain Standish’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
visit. His friend Timperley had bragged
of his familiarity with the captain; his friend Porkman
had boasted of the captain’s morning call. Mr.
Piper did not wish to be behind those compeers of
his. He had felt himself at a disadvantage when
they were lauding the all-accomplished Standish.</p>

<p>‘Well, Beller, my love,’ he said, when the guests
had all departed, and he sat down to a <i>tête-à-tête</i>
dinner with his wife, who was quite exhausted by
the cares and triumphs of the afternoon. ‘I’m glad
we’ve had Captain Standish at one of our Thursdays,
since people round Great Yafford think such a lot
about him; but I don’t see that he’s anything so
wonderful. He’s very much like all the other military
men I’ve seen—extra well got-up linen—a neat-cut
boot—and hair cropped as close as a convick’s.
That’s the general pattern, I take it.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mr Piper!’ cried Bella, horrified at this
blasphemy. ‘Can’t you see Captain Standish’s superiority?
There is a style—an air—a <i>je ne sais quoi</i>.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know about the <i>junnysaker</i>, but I’ll
allow that his clothes are a good cut,’ said the unimpressionable
Piper. ‘But why the dickens do the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
Porkmans and Timperleys think so much of him? I
shouldn’t have thought he was old Timperley’s sort.’</p>

<p>‘My dear Mr. Piper, Captain Standish is the
fashion.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that’s it, is it?’ said Mr. Piper, meekly.
‘Well, I like to be in the fashion as well as my
neighbours. Suppose we ask Captain Thingamy to
dinner? He’s not the sort of chap that would want
to borrow money of one, is he, by-the-bye? It’s a
way they’ve got in the army.’</p>

<p>‘Captain Standish borrow money!’ cried Bella.
‘Why his mother is Lady Emmeline Standish——.’</p>

<p>‘That wouldn’t fill his pockets,’ interjected Mr.
Piper.</p>

<p>‘And his father is a partner in a great bank. I
forget which, but some enormously rich bank. The
Porkmans know all about it.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, well, if his father is rich, he may come here as
often as he likes. I’m not afraid of a rich man; but
your needy fellows are always dangerous. They’re like
the serpent that warms itself at your hearth, and then
stings you. They eat your dinners, and wind up by
getting you to put your name to an accommodation
bill.’</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">AT HER CHARIOT WHEELS.</span></p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Captain Standish</span> did not wait to be asked to
dinner. He made his appearance at Little Yafford
Park within a few days of his first visit. This
time he rode over, and his hack was a thing to
wonder at.</p>

<p>‘I’m blest if he ain’t the first bit of horseflesh
we’ve had inside these stables!’ exclaimed Mr.
Piper’s coachman, who affected to despise the pair
of bays for which his master had given three
hundred guineas.</p>

<p>Mr. Piper was enjoying himself among his
friends at Great Yafford. There was a club in
that commercial town, at which Mr. Timperley and
Mr. Porkman and their associates assembled daily
to read the newspapers and discuss the money
market. They were all strong politicians, and
talked of politics as well as of the Stock Exchange,
but they contemplated all public events from one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
standpoint. What would be the effect on the
money market? How would this crisis in
France, or this artful move on the part of Russia,
or this pretty piece of business at Vienna affect
the demand for cotton? Would Palmerston’s last
great speech steady the price of consols?</p>

<p>Mr. Piper went to his club oftener now-a-days
than he had gone in the first Mrs. Piper’s time.
Bella was making him a man of fashion, as he
complained sometimes, with a fatuous delight in
his young wife’s frivolities. She would drive him
into Great Yafford in her pony carriage in the
morning, do an hour’s shopping at Banbury’s, or
get a new novel at the circulating library, and
fetch him in the afternoon in her barouche, after
making two or three calls on the commercial aristocracy;
for what is the use of having fine clothes,
if you cannot show them to somebody, or a carriage
and pair if you cannot keep it standing before
somebody’s door? Bella heartily despised the
Porkmans, Timperleys, Wigzells, and all their set;
but she was by nature an actress, and must have
a stage and an audience of some kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span></p>

<p>Thus it happened that Mr. Piper was at his club,
and that Bella received Captain Standish alone. It
was a lovely afternoon, the lawn was steeped in
sunshine, the flower-beds were almost too dazzling
to be looked at, the roses were in their midsummer
glory. Bella received her visitor in the garden.
She was fond of sitting out of doors. She liked to
see the width and grandeur of her domain, the
fallow deer grouped gracefully in the distance, the
cool shadows of beech and oak, the tall elms yonder
where the rooks had built for the last century.
Perhaps she knew that she looked her prettiest in
the garden, sitting in a low basket chair, in the shade
of spreading lime branches.</p>

<p>It was just the afternoon for archery. There was
not a breath of wind to blow the arrows about. The
noble old beeches shaded the long stretch of sward
where the targets had been set up, and made it
possible for an enthusiastic toxophilite to endure
the midsummer heat. Bella made quite light
of it.</p>

<p>‘I adore the summer,’ she said, when Captain
Standish expressed his fear that she might find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
archery too great an exertion, with the thermometer
at seventy-five in the shade. ‘I think I must
belong to the cat family, I so enjoy basking in the
sun.’</p>

<p>‘So do I,’ said the captain, who looked as fresh
and cool as if he had just come out of a water-cure
establishment; ‘and I detest the people who go
about the world mopping themselves and grumbling
at the heat on every decent summer day.’</p>

<p>Bella blushed. Mr. Piper had an unpleasant way
of mopping his face with a brown and yellow
bandanna on warm afternoons. She felt that
there must be many habits of his that would jar
on Captain Standish’s nerves, if ever they came
to be intimate.</p>

<p>The lesson was delightful. The captain was a
first-rate master, and after about an hour’s hard
work Bella’s arrows began to fly straight to the
target, instead of taking a slanting direction and
losing themselves under the beeches. This was
something gained. Once she went within half an
inch of the gold. And then, when her arm began
to ache desperately and she was obliged to give up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
Captain Standish took her bow, and in the easiest
way in the world, just like that famous marksman
who drew his bow at a venture, shot three arrows
in the gold, in the neatest little triangle.</p>

<p>‘I could write my name on the target,’ he said.
‘It’s the simplest thing in life when you’re used
to it.’</p>

<p>Bella looked at her watch. Half-past four
o’clock. How the afternoon had flown! She had
promised to call for her husband at his club, and
the carriage had been ordered for four. She explained
her engagement to Captain Standish, who
apologized for having detained her so long.</p>

<p>‘I was so pleased with your progress that I
forgot all about time,’ he said. ‘May I come to-morrow—a
little earlier? I want you to beat the
Miss Porkmans next Thursday. You will be shooting
on Thursday, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I dare say, if they come. I find archery
a great relief on my Thursday afternoons. It is something
for people to do. There is so little to talk
about in the country. You must find it very
trying, Captain Standish.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span></p>

<p>The captain shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>‘I’m used to country quarters,’ he said. ‘And
then in the very depths of Bœotia there are always
bright exceptions. But candidly, I don’t care much
for what people call society. I like to choose my
friends, and when I have chosen them I am an
enthusiast in friendship. Now pray put on your
bonnet, and don’t let Mr. Piper be kept waiting
through my indiscretion in staying so long. I’ll go
round to the stable for my horse. May I ride
beside your carriage part of the way, if I don’t make
too much dust?’</p>

<p>Bella blushed and sparkled at the idea. To
have this fine flower of the army, this glass of
fashion and mould of form riding beside her barouche
was an honour to boast of when next she met the
Porkmans. He had never ridden at their chariot
wheels. Cæsar’s triumph when he brought home
Vercingetorix was not grander than this.</p>

<p>Bella leaned back in her carriage, holding up
the daintiest lace-flounced parasol, just big enough
to shelter the tip of her nose, while the captain’s
sleek bay trotted at her side, and arched his neck,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
and sniffed the air, and gave himself resentful airs
at being forced to suit his pace to the jog-trot of the
over-fed carriage horses. They passed along the
village street, under the cloudless blue, and Bella
felt that the eye of the world—her little world—was
upon them. Miss Coyle was clipping her
solitary standard rose tree as they went by, and
stopped, scissors in hand, to stare at them. Cyril
Culverhouse was just coming out of his garden
gate, with a black book under his arm. Clementina
and Flora Scratchell were flattening their noses
against the parlour window as usual. That vision
of sisterly noses always greeted Bella as she passed.
This time she took care to be looking another way.
She did not want Captain Standish to know that her
‘people’ lived in the shabbiest house in the village.</p>

<p>The captain was far too good a horseman to
keep up that ‘‘ammer, ‘ammer, on the ‘ard ‘igh
road,’ of which the traditional cockney complained.
There were plenty of grassy bits by the wayside
where he was able to save his horse’s feet—stretches
of open down on which he could indulge himself
with a gallop. Sometimes he dropped behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
and walked his horse for a mile or so, and
then startled Bella by descending upon her suddenly
from some grassy height, fresh and cool, and riding
with a rein as light as a silken thread.</p>

<p>‘What a lovely horse that is!’ exclaimed Bella.
‘He seems able to do anything.’</p>

<p>‘He was able to throw most of his riders before I
got him,’ answered the captain; ‘but he’s tame
enough now.’</p>

<p>There was a roll in the animal’s eye, and a
liberal display of white, which went far to confirm
this account of his antecedents.</p>

<p>Captain Standish was riding beside the carriage
when they entered that newly-built suburb where
the plutocracy of Great Yafford had built their
habitations. They passed the Porkmans’ Grange,
with its red walls, Tudor casements, and impossible
gables, the Timperley Manor House, with its Norman
sugar-loaf towers, and the Wigzells’ Italian Gothic
Villa, all white stucco, terraced walks and scarlet
geraniums. Bella, like Cæsar, felt that her
triumph was complete. Captain Standish only left
her at the door of the club-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span></p>

<p>‘Well, little woman,’ cried Mr. Piper, when he
came tumbling into the barouche, with his white
beaver hat at the back of his head, and his brown
and yellow bandanna on active service. ‘You
haven’t kept me waiting—no, not at all, neither.’</p>

<p>Bella told him all about Captain Standish’s visit.
She was radiant with this small social success.</p>

<p>‘Didn’t I tell you that I’d introduce you into
tip-top society, old woman?’ exclaimed Mr. Piper.
‘You shall hold your own with the best of ’em.
I’ll spare no expense till I see you at the top of the
tree. We must give a dinner party next week, and
we’ll have Timperley, and Wigzell, and the whole
boiling.’</p>

<p>‘Captain Standish is always meeting them at
Great Yafford. Don’t you think we’d better ask
the Dulcimers—and some of the Little Yafford
people?’ suggested Bella.</p>

<p>‘Well, have it your own way, my dear. I like
to have the Vicar’s legs under my mahogany. It
looks respectable.’</p>

<p>Bella sent out her invitations for that day fortnight,
carefully excluding the manufacturing element.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
She impressed on Mr. Piper that he was to give no
accidental invitations. His impulsive hospitality
must not be allowed to spoil this particular party, as
in Bella’s opinion, at least, it had spoiled previous
parties, by the interpolation of ineligible guests.</p>

<p>‘Above all things let there be no Mr. Chumney,’
said Bella, authoritatively.</p>

<p>‘Chumney’s enjoying himself at Whitby,’ replied
Mr. Piper, ‘and don’t want to be beholden to
you for a dinner; but if you expect me to forget
that Chumney’s father was the first man that ever
gave me a week’s wages, you’ll find yourself disappointed.
I’d take a knife and cut my heart out, if
I thought it was capable of such base ingratitude.’</p>

<p>‘You may remember Mr. Chumney’s father as
much as you like, but you needn’t always be talking
of him, and of the time when you were glad to
earn twelve shillings a week,’ remonstrated Bella.
‘There’s no use in harping upon such things.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, there is,’ answered Mr. Piper, ‘it shows
that prosperity hasn’t made me proud.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Piper called at the Vicarage next day to
ensure the acceptance of her invitation. Mrs. Dulcimer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
had seen Captain Standish riding by the
Vicarage gate, in attendance on Bella’s barouche,
and had heard about that ride of his from ever so
many people already.</p>

<p>‘I don’t wonder people talk about him,’ said
Mrs. Dulcimer. ‘He sits his horse splendidly, and
there’s a wonderful style about him. One can see
at a glance that he has always mixed in the best
society.’</p>

<p>‘I hope you and Mr. Dulcimer can come to meet
him on Wednesday week,’ said Bella.</p>

<p>‘Is he really coming to you?’</p>

<p>‘I’ve asked him.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but he is so very exclusive. I hear he is
quite difficult to get. He is not at all fond of
visiting. He shoots and hunts a great deal, they
say, but doesn’t care for balls or parties.’</p>

<p>‘I think he will come,’ said Bella. ‘Colonel
O’Shaughnessy brought him to us last Thursday,
and he seemed quite to take to—Mr. Piper.’</p>

<p>‘And he was giving you a lesson in archery,
Miss Coyle told me. You must be very careful, my
dear. I thought you were just a little imprudent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
let him ride by your carriage yesterday. A man of
that kind would get you talked about in no time.’</p>

<p>‘My dear Mrs. Dulcimer, I don’t the least mind
being talked about.’</p>

<p>‘Bella!’</p>

<p>‘In fact, I rather like it.’</p>

<p>‘Bella! I don’t think I could endure my existence
if I thought that people talked about me,’ cried
Mrs. Dulcimer, solemnly. ‘Of course, in my case
it would be particularly awful. A vicar’s wife is
like Cæsar’s.’</p>

<p>‘Cæsar had so many wives,’ said Bella. ‘He
could hardly expect all of them to be respectable.’</p>

<p>‘My dear,’ exclaimed Mrs. Dulcimer, her whole
countenance suddenly illuminated, ‘I have such a
splendid idea.’</p>

<p>Bella looked anything but delighted.</p>

<p>‘What is it, dear Mrs. Dulcimer?’</p>

<p>‘What a husband Captain Standish would make for
your sister Clementina! My dear, he is the very man
for her. A man of high family—rolling in money—young—handsome.
<span class="smcap">What</span> a chance for that poor girl!’</p>

<p>‘My dear Mrs. Dulcimer, do you imagine that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
any man of high family would choose a wife out of
my father’s house?’</p>

<p>‘But he need not see her in her father’s house—at
any rate not till he is so deeply in love that he
will not care a straw whether her family are rich or
poor. He will see her at the Park—elegantly dressed—with
you. He will only think of her as your
sister. And if he were to propose I feel sure that
Mr. Piper would do something handsome for her.
He is the soul of generosity. You know that, Bella.’</p>

<p>‘He is very generous, but I cannot expect him to
give all my sisters fortunes.’</p>

<p>‘Not all of them, dear. No, of course not;—but
he would give Clementina something, if she were
going to make such a match as that. A man in his
position would willingly make some sacrifice to have
Captain Standish for his brother-in-law. Only think,
Lady Emmeline Standish would be your—something-in-law.
It would be so nice for you to have people
of high family belonging to you. It would give
you the <i>entrée</i> to county society.’</p>

<p>‘It would be very nice, I dare say,’ said Bella,
not elated by this brilliant perspective, ‘but it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
just the most unlikely thing to come to pass. A
man so run after as Captain Standish has been is
not likely to fall in love with Clementina.’</p>

<p>‘I am not so sure of that,’ said Mrs. Dulcimer,
sagely. ‘More wonderful things have happened
within my knowledge. Clementina is a very pretty girl,
almost as pretty as you, Bella. She has your complexion.
I hope you’ve invited her for Wednesday week.’</p>

<p>‘No, indeed I have not. It doesn’t do to be
overrun by one’s family always. You see I could
scarcely ask Tina without asking papa and mamma;
and that is quite out of the question.’</p>

<p>‘You might have her to stay with you,’ suggested
Mrs. Dulcimer. ‘She would help to amuse
your step-daughters.’</p>

<p>Elizabeth Fry and Mary Wolstencroft were
coming home for their summer vacation in a few
days, a return acutely dreaded by Bella.</p>

<p>‘Well, dear Mrs. Dulcimer, perhaps you are
right. It might be as well to have Clementina.’</p>

<p>She could not be more in the way than those
two troublesome step-daughters, Bella thought.</p>

<p>‘If you have your sister with you it will prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
people making disagreeable remarks when
Captain Standish calls on you,’ said Mrs. Dulcimer.
‘It must be so awkward for a young
woman like you to receive a gentleman, when
your husband is out.’</p>

<p>‘Captain Standish is not quite a dragon,’ replied
Bella, laughing. ‘I am not afraid of him.’</p>

<p>‘My dear, I am told he is a very fascinating
man,’ said Mrs. Dulcimer, ‘and that is the worst
kind of dragon for a young married woman. He
certainly ought to marry Clementina, and if you
and I exercise a little diplomacy I believe he
will do it. Look at your position. I feel proud of
that. If it hadn’t been for me you might have never
been Mrs. Piper. Poor Mr. Piper might never have
repeated his offer if I had not encouraged him.’</p>

<p>‘You are all that is kind and good,’ said Bella,
inwardly rebelling against this patronage and interference.</p>

<p>‘Now go and invite your sister to stay with
you, dear. And see that she is becomingly dressed.
And you can polish her up a little in the next
fortnight. Clementina sadly wants polish. She
has never had your opportunities, you know.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">PLAYING WITH FIRE.</span></p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Captain Standish</span> accepted Mrs. Piper’s invitation.
He rode over to answer her note in person;
and to give her another lesson in archery. This
time Clementina was with her and shared in the
lesson. Captain Standish had no objection to teach
two pretty girls instead of one, but he preferred Mrs.
Piper, as the prettier and more fascinating of the two.
She possessed a great superiority too, in his eyes, as
a married woman. It was the rule of this great
man’s life, when he condescended to flirtation, to
flirt with a married woman. No harm could come
of it to himself. There was always the risk of the
husband being made uncomfortable; but that was a
detail. Captain Standish was not afraid of making
a husband jealous, or even unhappy; but he was very
much afraid of compromising himself by flirtation
with a single woman, who might be absurd enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
to expect him to marry her, and whose friends might
make themselves disagreeable if he declined to do so.</p>

<p>He was therefore the very last man to walk into
the silken snare that Mrs. Dulcimer had set for him.
He was kind and courteous to Clementina, who was
ready to ‘worship him’ or to ‘rave about him’—in
the Porkman phraseology—at a moment’s notice; but
he reserved his tender attentions, his thrilling looks
and lowered tones, for Bella, for whom the sweet
poison, the social deadly nightshade of an unprincipled
man’s flatteries had already too great a charm.
Of the extent of the captain’s influence over her mind
Bella herself was not yet aware. Indeed, she believed
herself hardened against any such influence by the
counter poison of a previous love. She had loved
once, and loved unhappily, and therefore could never
love again. This she firmly believed, and, secure in
this belief, walked blindfold into danger. Her
pleasure in the captain’s society she ascribed to the
triumph of parading him before the astonished eyes
of Little Yafford, the delight of lording it over the
Porkmans, the fact that Captain Standish was the
fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span></p>

<p>The dinner party was a success. It was made up
of the <i>élite</i> of Little Yafford and the surrounding
neighbourhood—people who had ‘places’ of twenty
to thirty acres, and who were altogether the next
best thing to county families—Mr. and Mrs. Dulcimer,
Colonel O’Shaughnessy, and Captain Standish.
Clementina looked her prettiest, and was
complimented on her likeness to her sister.</p>

<p>‘Bella,’ said the Vicar’s wife in a confidential
tone, when the ladies were alone after dinner. ‘You
are doing a noble thing for your sister. In my opinion
Captain Standish is struck with her already.’</p>

<p>‘You are sanguine, dear Mrs. Dulcimer,’ answered
Bella, smiling. ‘I have not seen him particularly
attentive to her.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps not, but he has been particularly attentive
to you. He would naturally begin in that
way.’</p>

<p>Bella was not quite clear upon this point; she had
little faith in Mrs. Dulcimer’s judgment. Were not
the most miserable hours of her life, her one inexcusable
sin, referable to that lady’s mistake? But she
found it rather agreeable to have Clementina as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
companion. The girl was grateful, and willing to
be useful, and was not in the way.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dulcimer was so elated at the prospect of
another brilliant match, to be brought about by her
agency, that, towards the end of the evening, she took
Mr. Piper into her confidence.</p>

<p>‘Charming man, Captain Standish, isn’t he?’ she
asked.</p>

<p>‘I’ve ‘eard that remark made a good many times,
mum,’ he answered, candidly, ‘but as far as my
individual opinion goes I don’t see anything remarkable
about the captain that should single him out
from the ruck of military men. Perhaps his hair is
cropped a trifle closer, and his whiskers neater trimmed.
I don’t deny either that there’s a <i>junny serquaw</i>, as
my wife calls it, about the cut of his clothes, and that
he has a high way with him, as if we were all upon
a lower level, which I believe is uncommonly taking
for some people, though I can’t say I ever was took
by that kind of thing myself. I like a man who
is my superior and yet takes care not to remind me
of it. I can feel the superiority of that kind of man.
I don’t want it put before me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Dulcimer looked disappointed.</p>

<p>‘He is of a very high family,’ she said, ‘and
enormously rich.’</p>

<p>‘That’s always a satisfaction to one’s mind,
mum.’</p>

<p>‘Now don’t you think it would be a very
grand thing if he were to marry your sister-in-law
Clementina?’</p>

<p>Mr. Piper was not enthusiastic.</p>

<p>‘She might like it, Mrs. Dulcimer,’ he said.
‘That’s just according to her feelings. But it’s no
business of mine to find husbands for my wife’s
sisters.’</p>

<p>This was disheartening, but Mrs. Dulcimer was
not going to renounce her project because Mr.
Piper looked coldly upon it. Clementina stayed
at the Park, and Bella enriched her with a great
many dresses and other adornments of which she
was beginning to be tired, or which were of a
fashion that had become too general for a fine
lady’s wear. Generosity in a person of Bella’s
stamp is only another word for extravagance.
Bella would have as soon contemplated cutting off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
her right hand as giving away anything she wanted
herself. These gifts to Tina necessitated the purchase
of new things, and already the second Mrs.
Piper had begun to get into debt, and to feel that
she had bills which must be paid next year, or
at some more definite period. The three hundred
a year which Mr. Piper had settled upon her in
the fulness of his heart, as an all-sufficing income
for dress and pocket money, was not nearly enough
to supply the manifold wants of a young woman
who had been brought up in poverty. Bella wanted
everything, for everything was new to her. She
ran riot in laces, and silks, and velvets, bric-à-brac
for her boudoir, dainty stationery, devotional
books, which were seldom read, but which looked
well on her dressing-table, parasols, fans, slippers,
albums, everything of the costliest. She was surprised
to find how soon her ready money had
melted away, and almost afraid to calculate how
deeply she was in debt. But the burden weighed
lightly upon her. It would be easy to get Mr.
Piper to give her a cheque, when things got desperate.
He might be surprised, perhaps, that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
had not managed her allowance better; but he
would not have the strength of mind to refuse
her the money.</p>

<p>One day poor Mrs. Scratchell ventured to ask
her daughter for a little help. The tax-gatherer
was pressing, and ‘father’ had nothing put aside
for the taxes.</p>

<p>‘Oh, mamma,’ cried Bella, ‘what has he done
with Mr. Harefield’s five hundred pounds? That
ought to have set him up for life.’</p>

<p>‘My dear child, you must remember, surely.
Father acted with the greatest prudence, and invested
his legacy safely in railway shares. It
brings us twenty-seven pounds a year. It doesn’t
make a large addition, you see, and last year was
so expensive. Bread was a penny dearer than it
has been for ten years, and potatoes were dreadfully
scarce. Altogether things have got behindhand
with us——’</p>

<p>‘I never knew them to be beforehand,’ sighed
Bella.</p>

<p>‘But it’s a great comfort to see you so splendidly
established. I’m sure I feel a thrill whenever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
I enter this house and think, “This is my
daughter’s. My child is the mistress of it all.”
I feel almost as Esther’s relations must have felt
when they saw her sitting beside the king.
And now, dear, if you could let me have ten
pounds——’</p>

<p>‘My dear mother, I haven’t ten shillings.
Look, here’s my purse. You can count the silver,
if you like.’</p>

<p>She handed Mrs. Scratchell a toy of mother-o’-pearl
and gold, lined with rose-hued silk.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Bella, have you spent <i>all</i> your last half-year’s
income?’</p>

<p>‘Every sixpence, except what you see there.’</p>

<p>‘My love, you must have been very extravagant—after
such a trousseau as you had to start
with.’</p>

<p>‘Why, mamma, there were lots of things forgotten
in my trousseau. And then the fashions
are always changing, and I have given my sisters
such heaps of things. I dare say I have been
extravagant in that particular. I am sure I have
dressed Tina from head to foot.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span></p>

<p>‘You have been very good, dear; but I so
counted on you for the taxes. I thought a ten
pound note would be nothing to you.’</p>

<p>‘That was a tremendous mistake. I assure you
that for actual ready money I have been worse off
since I have been Mr. Piper’s wife than I was as
his governess. There are so many demands upon
my purse. But if I can do anything next Christmas——’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, dear. We must get on somehow, I
suppose. We always have struggled through our
difficulties, and I suppose we always shall, thanks
to Providence; but it’s a wearing life.’</p>

<p>The young Pipers came home for their holidays,
and ran riot amidst the splendours and luxuries that
Bella had introduced into the sober old house.
These young people liked Bella better as a stepmother
than they had liked her as a governess.
She was very indulgent, so long as they did not
spoil the furniture, or annoy her with too much of
their society. She gave the girls fine dresses, and
allowed them to share all her gaieties. She let
the boys ride her ponies, when she did not want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
to use them. In a word she was a model stepmother,
and everybody praised her, except Miss
Coyle, who never praised anybody, and Mr.
Chumney, who generally reserved his opinion as
something too valuable to be parted with except
under strongest pressure.</p>

<p>So the briefly glorious summer hurried by, and
Bella lived only for pleasure, and to be flattered
and followed by Captain Standish. She went to
a great many parties among the <span class="err" title="original: Wizgell">Wigzell</span>, Timperley,
and Porkman section of society, and to a
few among the professional classes and landed
gentry, which latter were not so splendid as the
mercantile entertainments, in the matter of eating
and drinking, and were not much more lively; for
whereas the Porkmans and Timperleys talked of
nothing but money-making, the landed gentry had
a language of their own which Bella, clever as she
was, had yet to learn. Captain Standish was teaching
her a great deal. Under his tuition she had
learned to look down upon her fellow-creatures as
an inferior set of beings, ‘mostly fools,’ to regard
mental culture as a process only valuable to schoolmasters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
college dons, clergymen, doctors, lawyers,
and that altogether subordinate race which has to
earn its bread by the sweat of its brains, to think
of money as a stepping-stone to social importance,
the pleasure of the present moment as the one
vital consideration, the future as an unknown quantity,
not worth serious thought.</p>

<p>This was the code of ethics which Bella learned
from Captain Standish, but before all and above
all he taught her to despise her husband, her husband’s
children, and her husband’s surroundings,
from the lordly Timperley, swelling with the importance
of the biggest mills in the district, to
the unpretending Chumney, living in modest retirement
upon an annuity of ninety pounds, the
result of his laborious existence.</p>

<p>Of this gradual corruption of his wife’s mind
honest Ebenezer Piper had no suspicion. Her
manner and conduct to him of late had been unexceptionable.
The deeper and stronger that feeling
of contemptuous aversion grew in the secret
depths of her heart, the more carefully did she
regulate her outward seeming. She had never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
appeared sweeter, fairer, or more guileless in her
husband’s eyes than when she was most inclined
to betray him. Vivien herself, that supreme type
of falsehood in woman, employed no finer art against
the enchanter Merlin than Bella used to guard
herself from the hazard of discovery.</p>

<p>She knew herself false to the core, not quite a
subject for the divorce court, but a creature whose
good angel had long left her, shuddering and
abhorrent.</p>

<p>Mr. Piper had not forgotten Mrs. Dulcimer’s
ideas about Captain Standish and Clementina, and
when he saw the captain and sister-in-law together
he was inclined to believe that there might be some
foundation for that inveterate matchmaker’s fancy.
The captain had a knack of being particularly
attentive to Tina under Mr. Piper’s eye.</p>

<p>And now autumn was approaching, the russet
corn was cut in the wide shadowless fields, the
ploughman’s white horses were seen moving slowly
along the upland ridges, against a cool gray sky.</p>

<p>Captain Standish went up into the wildest part
of the moors for a fortnight’s grouse-shooting, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
to everybody’s surprise came back to Great Yafford
in three days.</p>

<p>He rode over to the Park on the afternoon of
his return, and found Bella alone, yawning over a
novel. She started and dropped her book when the
footman announced him, and changed from pale
to red, and red to pale again.</p>

<p>‘You did not expect to see me so soon,’ said the
captain, keeping her little cold hand in his.</p>

<p>‘No,’ she faltered, unable to say more.</p>

<p>‘You thought I should be able to endure a fortnight’s
life without you. I was fool enough to
think so too—and made all my arrangements for
staying away till the 27th. But three days were
quite enough. How pale and tired you look!’</p>

<p>‘I have had nothing to do, and I suppose that is
the most tiring thing in the world. Tina has gone
home. I did not want Mr. Piper to think that she
was going to live here always.’</p>

<p>‘What does it matter what he thinks?’ said
Captain Standish, with his supercilious smile. ‘Mr.
Piper was only created to be useful to you and your
relations. And so you have missed—Tina.’</p>

<p>‘I have been very dull.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span></p>

<p>‘If you knew how desolate my life was in those
three days you would pity me,’ said the captain,
tenderly. ‘Yes, Isabel, you would pity me for being
so weak that I cannot live without you, so miserably
placed that I am obliged to hide my love.’</p>

<p>And then Captain Standish went on to tell his
story; the old, old story, the familiar melody, subject
to such endless variations, such kaleidoscopic distinctions
without difference, and always coming to
the same thing in the end. ‘We might have been
happy had Providence willed it. Let us defy Providence,
fling honour to the winds, and be happy in
spite of fate.’</p>

<p>He talked and pleaded for a long time, and Bella
listened with lowered eyelids, and lowered head, and
let her hand lie locked in his, and did not answer
his specious arguments by one straight outspoken
denial. She paltered with this tempter, as she had
paltered with temptation all her life, always choosing
the road she liked best. She said neither yes nor
no. It was an awful thing that he was asking her to
do. No more nor less than to surrender honour,
social status, everything for his sake, to go to Italy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
with him, and live a gay, unfettered life there, among
people who, according to his showing, would be
willing to accept her as his wife. He painted the
picture of that ideal Italian life so vividly that all
the hideousness of his proposal was lost sight of
under that bright colouring.</p>

<p>‘Remember, dearest, I shall have my sacrifice
to make too,’ he said. ‘I must leave the army.
And I shall almost break my poor mother’s
heart, for she has plans for my marriage which
she has cherished ever since I was at Eton.
But I could sacrifice a great deal more than
that for your sake.’</p>

<p>‘Do not talk of it any more,’ said Bella, in
a frightened voice. ‘It is too awful. I like
you—yes,’ as he drew her face round to him
so that her eyes reluctantly met his,—‘yes, very
much. I hardly think’—falteringly and in tears—‘I
could go on living if you went away, and I
were not to see you any more; but what you
are asking is horrible—to defy everybody—to give
up everything—to be pointed at and spoken of
as something utterly lost and wretched—a thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
to be spurned by other women—women who are
my inferior in everything—except that one wicked
act. Why, my very housemaids would look down
upon me. No, I could not be so degraded. I
could not sink so low.’</p>

<p>‘I see,’ said Captain Standish. ‘You love yourself
and your good name better than you love
me. You were not ashamed to sell yourself to
Piper. The world applauds that kind of bargain.
But you are not generous enough to give yourself
to the man you love.’</p>

<p>He had let go her hand, and was walking
with long quick steps backwards and forwards
across the deep bay, like a lion in a cage. Bella
thought there was something grand and noble
about him in this lofty rage. She loved him all
the more for the hard things he said to her,
since his hard speeches proved the intensity of
his love.</p>

<p>‘You are very cruel,’ she said, piteously.</p>

<p>‘I am very much in earnest. I thought to
find in you something better and grander than
the shallow conventional woman of society who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
only plays with hearts, who wants to walk through
the deep waters of passion without wetting her
feet. You talk of sinking very low—of degradation.
Where is the degradation in the life I
offer you—the fair sweet unfettered life that poets
have loved ever since the world began?’</p>

<p>‘You would be tired of an idle life in Italy,’
said Bella.</p>

<p>‘With you, no. But we could wander about.
We should not be tied to one spot. I would
take you to Algiers—Morocco. We could ride
over that strange land together—and when we
had used up the Old World we would be off to
the New. I would take you across the Rocky
Mountains. I would make you my comrade and
companion—a hardy traveller—a dead shot. You
should be no slavish English wife, sitting at home
while your husband enjoyed his life. No, love,
you should share every sport I had, hunt with
me—shoot—fish—row—ride with me. I would
not have a pleasure in life that you could not
share.’</p>

<p>The picture was full of charm for a woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
who, in her eagerness to enjoy life, had already
almost exhausted the pleasures of humdrum existence.
Bella felt that this would indeed be the
beginning of a new life; this would be to drain
to the dregs the cup of youth and gladness.
And then worldly pride for once took the shape
of a good angel, and pointed to the view from
that wide bay-window, the Park and deer, the
avenue of goodly elms, the grandeur and importance
of her position as Mrs. Piper. Was
she to surrender all this, and give up her name
to be a byeword and a reproach into the bargain?
No, she had hearkened too long to the
tempter, but she was not weak enough for this.</p>

<p>‘You must never speak to me of this again,’
she exclaimed. ‘I will try to think there has
been no serious meaning in what you have said.
Let us both forget it.’</p>

<p>‘I shall not forget it,’ said the captain, ‘but
if you tell me to keep silence I will obey. I
would do anything rather than live out of your
society.’</p>

<p>‘If you ever repeat what you have said this
afternoon, our friendship will be ended.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span></p>

<p>‘Anything sooner than that.’</p>

<p>He took the little hand again and kissed it
tenderly. So there was a kind of compact between
them. He was to go on adoring her, but
was to say nothing about it.</p>

<p>Captain Standish rode back to Great Yafford
in excellent humour. He had considerably embellished
the fact of his return, in his conversation
with Mrs. Piper. He had come back because
the weather had been abominable, and the birds
hardly visible behind a dense curtain of driving
rain. Three days of such uncomfortable sport
had been quite enough for the captain.</p>

<p>‘Poor little thing,’ he mused, as he walked his
horse, after a swinging galop over a grassy waste,
‘how very weak she is! I am glad she doesn’t
want me to run away with her. It would be
uncommonly inconvenient. But when a man has
flirted as desperately as I have a woman expects
him to say something serious. She’s really very
pretty—quite the most fascinating little thing I’ve
met for a long time. And if she were single—all
things being equal—I don’t think I should
object to marry her.’</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">A TURN OF FORTUNE’S WHEEL.</span></p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Cyril Culverhouse</span> lived his useful life, full of
thought and care for others, honoured, beloved,
but with a deep and settled sadness at his heart.
He could not forget the woman he loved, he
could not forgive himself for having doubted her.
Both their lives were blighted by that mistake;
and yet, looking back, he knew that he had
tried to do his duty. Love seemed a snare of
Satan, and he had cut himself free from its
meshes. But after that meeting in the churchyard
all his doubts vanished, his judgment wavered
no longer. There is a power in simple truth,
when we meet it face to face, that is stronger
than all reasoning upon a chain of possibilities.</p>

<p>He was convinced for ever of her guiltlessness,
in the hour when he believed her irrevocably
lost to him. Could he ever forget that meeting—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
one despairing kiss—the sight of her lying
at his feet among the rank grass that grows on
graves? And she had confessed her love for him,
by flying from a loveless marriage.</p>

<p>Could he follow her?—search this wide world
for her? How small a penance would it be to
wander over all the earth for her sake! But he
felt he had no right to pursue her. He had
wronged her too deeply to persecute her by a
pursuit which no sign from her invited. It was
for her to make that sign—it was for her to
pity and pardon him.</p>

<p>‘Let me go on doing my duty,’ he said to
himself, ‘and if it is God’s will that I am to be
happy in that way, happiness will come to me.
Yes, it will come some day, when I least look
for it, as the angels came to Abraham.’</p>

<p>So he went on with his simple unpretending
life, working with a quiet earnestness which
achieved wonders. It was one of his chief
gifts to do all things quietly. He worked almost
as silently as the bounteous fertilizing sun.</p>

<p>The school was thriving under Emmanuel Joyce’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
care. The widow’s heart did verily sing for joy,
so sweet was her new life amidst rural sights and
sounds, after the squalid misery of the Bridford
courts and alleys.</p>

<p>The Vicar was delighted to have his old pupil
back again. All the cares of the parish were lifted
off his shoulders when he had Cyril for his curate.
He knew that, if he was luxuriating in scholarly idleness,
there was nothing being neglected. When he
was wanted Cyril called upon him, and he obeyed
the call. He gave of his substance freely at Cyril’s
bidding. There could not have been a better alliance.
Clement Dulcimer, all sweetness and light, shedding
smiles and kindliness upon his parishioners, Cyril
Culverhouse, the earnest worker, not withholding
reproof when it was needful. Between them they
made Little Yafford a model parish, an ideal republic,
in a small way.</p>

<p>The Vicar had taken a great fancy to the new
schoolmaster. Joyce’s love of books was in itself a
passport to Mr. Dulcimer’s favour. He invited the
young man to spend an evening with him occasionally,
and Emmanuel revelled in long hours of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
talk upon far-reaching questions—conversations from
which Mr. Dulcimer let himself slip insensibly into
a monologue, and poured forth his stores of curious
uncatalogued knowledge. In one thing only he was
rather hard upon the aspiring student. He set his
face strongly against Emmanuel’s poetic efforts.</p>

<p>‘They are as good as most of the prize poems it
has been my lot to read,’ he said, after he had conscientiously
gone through Emmanuel’s little collection
of manuscript verses, ‘but then you see a prize poem
is generally the flattest thing in life. As intellectual
efforts they do you credit, and as mental training I’ve
no doubt the composition of them has been serviceable
to you. But I will not be so weak as to say
go on writing verses. There are about twenty poets
born in a century, and about twenty thousand
rhymesters. Shall a wise man waste his life—his
brief precious sum of days and hours—in labouring
to develop the rhymester into the poet? Why, the
poet knows himself for a poet before he is twenty.
The man upon whom that mantle has fallen, the man
who is born to wear that crown, cannot be mistaken
about himself. Look at Pope, Chatterton, Shelley,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
Byron, Keats—boy poets all. And is a man who
has not put forth that supreme flower of genius in
his youth to go on cudgelling his brain for rhymes, in
the hope that labour will make him a poet? It is
the stuff behind the rhymes that is wanting in him.
He has nothing to say. But he thinks if he can say
nothing melodiously—to somebody else’s tune—that
he may make himself a poet. Wasted labour, idle
delusion. Go into philosophy, natural science, criticism,
history—anything you like, my dear young
friend—the field is wide, and in these studies a man
can make himself. God makes poets.’</p>

<p>Emmanuel took the lesson to heart, humiliating
as it was. For a long time he had hugged the idea
that he was a poet. That electro-plated verse of his,
modelled upon the verse of other singers, had for his
deluded ear the ring of genuine silver. Granted that
there were only twenty poets born in a century. It
seemed to him no less hard that he could not be one
of the twenty. He had no pity for the nineteen
thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine versifiers,
self-deluded like himself, and doomed to disappointment
as bitter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span></p>

<p>It took him some time to recover from the shock
which his self-esteem had received from Mr. Dulcimer’s
candour. At first it seemed to him that if
he could not be a poet he could be nothing else.
Those other fields of intellectual labour in which the
Vicar invited him to work, offered no attraction.
They were all dry and barren; he saw no flowers to
be gathered there. Ambition seemed dead within
him, now that a judge in whom he believed had told
him that he was not an incipient Byron.</p>

<p>‘You never write of an evening now, Emmanuel,’
his mother said to him, when the shortening days of
September brought them together by their cheerful
fireside. ‘I hope you haven’t grown tired of your
pen?’</p>

<p>‘I have,’ he answered. ‘What’s the use of writing
trash?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Emmanuel, how can you talk so? I’m sure
I never read sweeter verses than yours.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, mother, you think them sweet because I
am your son. You wouldn’t care a straw for them
if they were written by a stranger. Come, I’ll read
you a bit of real poetry, and you’ll see the difference.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span></p>

<p>He opened his well-used Milton, and read the
hymn on the Nativity. He knew those noble verses
by heart, and declaimed them well.</p>

<p>‘What do you think of that mother?’ he asked,
when he had finished.</p>

<p>‘I don’t understand it all, dear,’ she answered
meekly, ‘there are so many heathen idols in it.
But it’s poetry that rings like a great brazen bell,
and there’s more words in it than in yours.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, mother, that’s it. The man who wrote that
was a born poet. He could do what he liked with
the language, and make it ring like sound metal.
My verse is like a poor little cracked sheep-bell,
and sounds no better than tin. And I haven’t above
a quarter of the English language in my vocabulary.
I’ve read a great deal, but the words don’t come to
my finger ends in all their wealth and variety, as
they did to Shelley and Keats. No, mother, I’m no
poet. Mr. Dulcimer is a good judge. If I write
anything it must be prose.’</p>

<p>‘I hope Mr. Dulcimer hasn’t been putting you
out of conceit with yourself, Emmanuel.’</p>

<p>‘He has only told me the truth, mother. That’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
always good for a man to know, though it takes him
aback sometimes to hear it.’</p>

<p>‘I should be very sorry to see you give up your
pen, dear,’ said the mother, persistently. ‘I should
be so proud if I could live to see you an author.’</p>

<p>‘Well, mother, I will try to write a book, if it is
only to please you. I will write something for my pupils—a book that may be useful and popular in
schools all over England. The English history my
boys read seems to me very dull and dry. I
think I’ll try my hand at a boy’s history of England.
I fancy I could make it interesting.’</p>

<p>‘I’m sure you could,’ said the mother, fondly.</p>

<p>Here at least in this quiet schoolhouse parlour
was happiness almost perfect. It was a delight to
Cyril Culverhouse, when he dropped in for half an
hour on his homeward way, to see how well this one
good work of his had prospered.</p>

<p>A great change in Cyril’s fortune was at hand—a
change that came upon him as an almost overwhelming
blow, for it gave a new colour to his life,
and made the problem of existence doubly difficult.</p>

<p>Walking home to his lodgings one September<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
afternoon with Mr. Dulcimer, Cyril met the village
postman.</p>

<p>‘Any letters for me, Sparkes?’ asked the Vicar.</p>

<p>Cyril was not curious enough to inquire about
his letters. He expected no pleasant tidings. Who
should write to him? He stood alone in the world,
for he did not hope that his cousin would ever
regard him with friendliness again.</p>

<p>‘No, sir, there ain’t none for you,’ replied
Sparkes; ‘but there’s a letter for you, Mr. Culverhouse,
from Indy.’</p>

<p>Kenrick had written then, after all, thought
Cyril, moved at the idea. Distance and lapse of
time had softened the natural bitterness of his
feelings.</p>

<p>And then and there, in deliberate defiance of
the postal rules and regulations, Sparkes handed the
curate a thin miserable-looking letter, in a black-edged
envelope, addressed by a strange hand.</p>

<p>The Vicar and Cyril both looked at it, horror-struck.</p>

<p>‘Your cousin has been killed,’ cried Mr.
Dulcimer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span></p>

<p>Cyril felt the same apprehension. He knew
no one in India except his cousin. This letter
in a strange hand must bring evil tidings.</p>

<p>He opened the envelope hurriedly, with a
shaking hand, as he and Mr. Dulcimer stood side
by side in the quiet country road. The Vicar
read the letter over Cyril’s shoulder.</p>

<p>Yes, it brought the news both feared.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—It is with deep regret that I write to
inform you of the death of your cousin, Sir Kenrick
Culverhouse. He was shot in a skirmish with
the Burmese, which took place on the night of
July 27th. They came down upon our camp
unexpectedly during the night, and were repulsed
with considerable loss, but unhappily your cousin,
who was always reckless in exposing himself to
the enemy’s fire, received a fatal shot while leading
his company in close pursuit of the retreating
Burmese.</p>

<p>‘There will, I hope, be some consolation to
you, as his nearest relative, in knowing how nobly
he did his duty throughout the last eighteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
months, and how thoroughly he won the respect
of his regiment, from the highest to the lowest.
For my own part, I feel his death as a personal
loss, and it will be long before I shall cease to
deplore it.</p>

<p class="center">
‘I have the honour to be<br />
‘Your obedient servant<br />
‘<span class="smcap">Malcolm Donaldson</span>.’
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘That is the colonel of his regiment,’ said the
Vicar. ‘Poor Kenrick! Do you know, I had a
presentiment that he would never come back to
us. Hard to remember that he left us under such
miserable circumstances.’</p>

<p>Cyril was silent for some moments, and then
he said, suddenly, with intense earnestness,—</p>

<p>‘Would to God that I rather than he had
drawn the lot of death!’</p>

<p>‘The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole
disposing thereof is of the Lord,’ said the Vicar,
solemnly. ‘We cannot choose our path in life,
Cyril. Fate has not been kind to Kenrick. This
is a heavy blow for both of us. For my own part,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
I feel as if I had lost a son. You and Kenrick
have been as sons to me.’</p>

<p>‘And to me he was like a brother,’ said Cyril.
‘We parted in unkindness. <i>That</i> is a bitter thing
to remember.’</p>

<p>‘I do not think you can blame yourself,
Cyril, because your cousin’s engagement ended unhappily.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ said Cyril. ‘It is just possible
I may have influenced Beatrix at the last.’</p>

<p>And then he told Mr. Dulcimer, as a good
Catholic might tell his spiritual director, about
that meeting in the churchyard.</p>

<p>‘I hardly know what I said,’ he confessed,
remorsefully; ‘I was beside myself. I knew in
that moment she still loved me, that I had never
ceased to love her—that I had been mad—foolish—besotted
when I doubted her. I knew all this,
and that to-morrow was to make her my cousin’s
wife. I know not what mad words I may have
said to her—words wild and strong enough to
constrain her to break with Kenrick.’</p>

<p>‘I am not sure of that,’ said Mr. Dulcimer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
thoughtfully. ‘I have a shrewd suspicion that
Beatrix was meditating breaking off her engagement
when she was so eager to redeem the
Culverhouse mortgages. If she had meant to be
his wife she might just as well have waited till
they were married. But she was so impetuous,
so determined. She bore down all opposition from
Scratchell. Yes, I believe that she had made up her
mind to jilt poor Kenrick, and that she meant the
liberation of his estate as an atonement.’</p>

<p>This was some kind of consolation to Cyril,
who thought of his cousin with a remorseful grief
that was very real. And now, when those first
days of mourning for the dead were over, he began
to think of his own position, which was full of
perplexity.</p>

<p>Kenrick’s death had made him master of
Culverhouse Castle. He had new ties, new duties.
His first thought was to repay Miss Harefield the
fifty thousand pounds. The lawyers had dawdled
about the matter, Mr. Dulcimer had been careless,
and Kenrick’s parting injunction had not been
obeyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span></p>

<p>Cyril went to Mr. Scratchell and told him that
he should mortgage the estate directly it passed
into his possession, and restore Miss Harefield’s
money.</p>

<p>‘She meant it for my cousin Kenrick, and not
for me,’ he said. ‘I should feel myself a thief
if I retained the use of her money a day longer
than I am obliged.’</p>

<p>It was agreed therefore that the money should
be refunded as soon as Cyril found himself in a
position to raise money upon his newly acquired
estate. He was now Sir Cyril, an empty honour
which he had no intention of parading among the
simple people who only knew him as ‘the parson,’
and who might possibly think a baronet less approachable
and sympathetic in their difficulties and
griefs than plain ‘mister.’</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">MR. PIPER ASSERTS HIMSELF.</span></p>

<p class="noin">‘<span class="smcap">You</span> ride, of course,’ Captain Standish said to Bella,
upon one of her Thursday afternoons, in the middle
of September.</p>

<p>Bella blushed. She had never mounted a horse
in her life.</p>

<p>‘I am very fond of riding,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘Have you ever ridden to hounds?’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean hunted?’ she asked, naively.
‘Oh no, never.’</p>

<p>‘Then you must begin this winter. I’ll show
you the way, and take care of you.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t think Mr. Piper would let me hunt,’
said Bella, dubiously. ‘I’ve heard him abuse hunting
ladies; and as he never rides himself——’</p>

<p>‘What has that to do with it?’ asked the captain,
contemptuously.</p>

<p>Captain Standish had long cast off all semblance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
of respect in his manner of speaking about Mr. Piper.
Bella had taken that first desperate step in a woman’s
downward course which a wife takes when she submits
to hear her husband depreciated.</p>

<p>‘What has Mr. Piper’s taste to do with your
pleasure? It would be very difficult to find a horse
that would carry him, and I suppose he would ride
in about as good form as a sack of coals. I should
so like you to hunt with me, Isabel. You must
make him buy you a good hunter.’</p>

<p>Captain Standish was the only person who had
ever called her Isabel. He had chosen to call her
thus, in their confidential moments, because every
one else called her Bella. The moment in which he
had spoken that name marked an epoch in her life.
She could look back and remember. They were
standing side by side under the big beech, she leaning
on her bow, as she stopped to rest after a dozen shots,
when he bent over her to take the arrow out of her
hand, and praised her for her skill in archery.</p>

<p>‘I am so proud of your progress, Isabel.’</p>

<p>The name spoken tenderly, in a subdued voice, was
as startling as a name whispered in a sleeper’s ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span></p>

<p>‘You must not call me by my Christian name,
Captain Standish,’ she said, making her poor little
protest, which he knew meant nothing.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I must. It is the only name pretty enough
for you. I have a choking sensation every time
I have to call you Mrs. Piper.’</p>

<p>So from that time forward he had called her
Isabel, whenever they found themselves alone.</p>

<p>‘I don’t think Mr. Piper would let me ride,
much less hunt,’ said Bella, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>‘Yes, he would. You know very well that you
can twist him round your little finger.’</p>

<p>‘I should dearly love hunting,’ she said, with a
vague idea of skimming over ploughed fields, like a
swallow, and flying over fences upon a horse whose
only desire was to jump.</p>

<p>‘Get Piper to give his consent to your having a
horse of your own, and let me choose one for you.
I think you could trust my choice.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed I could,’ sighed Bella.</p>

<p>That idea of hunting had taken possession of her
narrow little mind already. It seemed the one thing
needful to her happiness, the one distinction necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
to raise her to the social pinnacle she was always
trying to scale. It would bring her into familiar
intercourse with the county people, and then her
prettiness and pleasing manners would do the rest.
In the hunting field she would stand alone, not borne
down by Mr. Piper’s vulgarity.</p>

<p>‘I’ll tell you how to manage Piper,’ said the
captain. ‘Say that you are out of health, and that
your doctor has ordered you to ride. You can
make your doctor order anything you like, you
know. He’ll take the hint, if he sees you’ve set your
heart upon riding, and he’ll tell Piper that it’s a
matter of vital necessity.’</p>

<p>Bella acted upon this idea. She was not so
healthy a subject as Mrs. Piper as she had been
when she was Miss Scratchell. She had languors,
and nervous headaches, and shooting pains, and
divers spasmodic or hysterical affections which
were unknown to her in the days of her poverty.
Hard work and hard living are the best regimen
for these disorders. Bella had plenty of leisure
now for imaginary ailments, and really believed
herself a peculiarly delicate piece of human
mechanism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span></p>

<p>She sent for Mr. Namby the day after this conversation
with Captain Standish, and told him she
was feeling low and nervous, and that she feared
there must be something radically wrong, something
organic.</p>

<p>Now if the village surgeon had been attending
Miss Scratchell he would have laughed such a
notion to scorn, but this idea of organic disease in
the mistress of the Park was not to be dismissed
too lightly. The Park had been an important
source of Mr. Namby’s income, in the late Mrs.
Piper’s time, and he did not want the doors to be
shut upon him now, so he smiled his most sympathetic
smile, and gave a gentle sigh; the smile
to re-assure, the sigh to express fore-knowledge
of every evil the Fates had in store for his patient;
and then he put his two fingers gently upon Bella’s
wrist, looking at his watch the while, as if a beat
more or less in the minute were a matter of supreme
importance.</p>

<p>‘Thready,’ he said, shaking his head gravely.</p>

<p>‘I have a weak pulse, have I not?’ asked Bella.
‘I fancy I want exercise—open air—a more invigorating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
life. I drive a good deal; but there is not
much exercise in that, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Very little,’ assented Mr. Namby.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you think riding might be good for
me?’</p>

<p>‘The very thing I was about to recommend.’</p>

<p>‘But I’m afraid Mr. Piper might not like me
to ride,’ suggested Bella.</p>

<p>‘From my knowledge of Mr. Piper’s devotion to
you, my dear madam, I feel assured that he would
not oppose anything likely to be of benefit to
you,’ said Mr. Namby, with conviction.</p>

<p>‘Then perhaps you will be kind enough to
mention it to him. Stop and take your luncheon
with us. He is generally at home for luncheon. I
feel that I ought to do something, I am getting
into such a low way. I began to fancy my heart
was affected.’</p>

<p>‘If there really were anything wrong about
the heart, riding would be dangerous.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I dare say it is only indigestion, caused
by want of exercise.’</p>

<p>Mr. Namby stayed to luncheon. His practice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
was not so extensive as to forbid his indulging
himself with a little leisure once in a way. He
had not enjoyed himself so much for a long time;
indeed, not since Bella’s wedding breakfast, at
which he had been a humble guest, squeezed
into a corner at the foot of the table, where very
few people saw him, and where some of the best
dishes never penetrated.</p>

<p>Mr. Piper happened to be in a particularly good
humour. He had been speculating a little, by way
of amusement, in woollen goods, and his venture
had turned up trumps. He opened a bottle of his
best champagne for Mr. Namby, a rose-tinted
wine, that creamed and sparkled gently in the
shallow glass, and did not run over in foolish
froth, like ginger beer.</p>

<p>Mr. Namby took some curried lobster, and a
mutton cutlet, and the breast of a partridge, and
a bit of Harrogate cheese, and a bunch of Mr.
Piper’s famous Alexandria Muscats, which had
cost a small fortune to grow, and he had a very
fair share of the rose-tinted champagne; and after
being thus regaled, he declared, with conviction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
that horsemanship was the one thing needed to
restore Mrs. Piper to perfect health.</p>

<p>‘Why, there’s nothing the matter with her
that I can see,’ exclaimed Mr. Piper, taking his wife’s
little hand, and making a sandwich of it between
two puffy paws. ‘She’s as pretty as ever, and
she’s as plump as the partridges we’ve just eaten.’</p>

<p>‘These nervous disorders are very insidious,’
said Mr. Namby.</p>

<p>‘What should make her nervous?’</p>

<p>‘We’ve had so many parties,’ said Bella. ‘And
your Great Yafford friends are so coarse and noisy.
I always feel tired to death after an hour or
two of their society. And we have been to so
many of their wearisome dinners. Nothing wears
me out like one of those stupid dinners, where
we sit three hours at table, wondering when the
hired footmen will leave off bringing round dishes
that nobody wants, except the people whose only
pleasure in life is gluttony.’</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Piper has a very feeble pulse,’ said Mr.
Namby, after a lingering sip of Madeira. ‘She
wants fresh air and vigorous exercise.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span></p>

<p>‘She can go out walking. I dare say she has
given way to laziness a bit since she’s had three
carriages at her command. It’s a new sensation for
her, poor little lass. She had to stir her stumps,
trudging backwards and forwards from here to the
village every day, when she was governess to my
girls.’</p>

<p>Bella was dumb with disgust and indignation.
To have a husband who spoke of her thus! Who
made his pompous boast of having picked a pearl
out of the gutter.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know about walking exercise,’ said Mr.
Namby, who knew that his patient wanted a horse,
and nothing but a horse. ‘That might possibly be
too fatiguing for Mrs. Piper. Now riding is exercise
without fatigue.’</p>

<p>‘Well, then, I suppose she must ride,’ exclaimed
Mr. Piper, with an air of resignation. ‘If she has
set her heart upon it she’ll do it, cost what it may.
Yes, at the risk of breaking her neck, and an old
fool’s heart into the bargain. There never was such
a girl for having her own way. Look at her,
Namby! Wouldn’t you think she was the softest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
bit of pink and white womanhood that ever mother
Nature moulded, a gentle little puss that would sit
on your lap, and purr with good temper and contentment,
a lump of softness and affection that never
knew what it was to have a will of her own?
That’s what I thought before I married her. But I
know better now. She’s as hard as nails, and when
she wants anything she’ll have it, if it was to cost
you your fortune.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t think I am asking for anything very
dreadful,’ said Bella. ‘A horse which may cost you
a hundred pounds——’</p>

<p>‘Oh, hang it!’ cried Piper. ‘We’ve horses enough.
If you must ride you can ride one of the carriage
horses.’</p>

<p>‘A creature nearly seventeen hands high,’
exclaimed Bella, contemptuously. ‘I don’t want to
ride a camel. Pray say no more about it. It is Mr.
Namby’s idea that I ought to ride, not mine.’</p>

<p>‘Does she really want it?’ asked the bewildered
Piper, appealing to the surgeon.</p>

<p>‘I think it might give her tone. There is a
decided want of tone at present.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span></p>

<p>‘There was no want of tone when she used to
come every morning to teach my children. She
used to look as fresh as a newly opened rose.’</p>

<p>‘She had not the cares of a large household upon
her shoulders in those days,’ suggested Mr. Namby.</p>

<p>‘The household doesn’t trouble her. She isn’t
like poor Moggie, who fretted herself to fiddle-strings
about sixpences. She’s a born lady, is the duchess
yonder. She sits in an easy chair and reads novels,
and lets the household take care of itself. If poor
Moggie could rise from the grave and take a peep at
our servants’ hall——well, it’s a comfort she can’t,
for I’m sure she’d never go back again.’</p>

<p>‘Pray say no more,’ said Bella, getting up and
going towards the door. ‘You have said more than
enough already. I would not let you buy me a
horse now if you were to go down on your knees
to beg me.’</p>

<p>‘Hoity, toity!’ cried Mr. Piper, but Bella had
bounced out of the room, leaving him face to face
with Mr. Namby, who, alarmed at the storminess of
the domestic sky, made haste to depart.</p>

<p>Mr. Piper ordered the pony carriage—his wife’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
pony carriage—and drove himself to Great Yafford.
This appropriation of Bella’s carriage and ponies was
an act of self-assertion on his part, and was meant
as a kind of manifesto. He felt that the time had
come when he must be master. But it was the most
joyless drive he had ever taken. The very road
looked dreary, barren, and uncomfortable in the
autumnal light. How fast the leaves were falling,
how dull and cold everything looked. Yes, assuredly
Summer had gone. He had hardly noticed it till
now. He loitered at his club while the ponies were
being rested and fed, and contrived to be home rather
late for dinner. He expected black looks from Bella
when he went into the drawing-room, where she was
waiting, daintily dressed, with the unfailing novel
open in her lap; but to his surprise she received him
as pleasantly as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>This mollified him, and he made no further
attempt at self-assertion that evening.</p>

<p>‘I hope you didn’t want your ponies, little
woman,’ he said. ‘I took ’em.’</p>

<p>‘My ponies,’ laughed Bella. ‘As if anything I
have were really mine! I am like the butterflies in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
the garden. I enjoy all the sweets, but I don’t pay
for them, and they don’t belong to me.’</p>

<p>‘That’s not true, Bella, and you know it,’
exclaimed Mr. Piper. ‘You haven’t forgotten the
marriage service. “With all my worldly goods I
thee endow.” I endowed you with my worldly
goods, Bella, and, without wishing to hurt your
feelings, I must say that so far you’ve made pretty
free with ’em. But I see how it is, you’re offended
because I refused you a saddle-horse this morning.
Well, perhaps it was rather mean of me, especially
after I’d made a little bit of money by a side wind.
But you see, we’ve been spending a lot this year,
and I began to feel it was time to pull in a bit.
However, I’ve been talking to White, and he says
the carriage horses are too tall for a lady, and they
might throw themselves forward from the habit of
hanging on the collar; so never mind, my pet, you
shall have a saddle-horse, and as far as a hundred
pounds will go you shall have a good one.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Bella, drawing herself up, ‘after what
you said to-day—before Mr. Namby, too, no doubt
it’s all over the village by this time—I wouldn’t let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
you spend another sixpence upon me. You made
me feel my dependence too keenly. You expected
me to be quite a different kind of wife, yielding, subservient,
without an idea of my own, like a Circassian
slave, bought in the market-place. No, Mr. Piper, I
am not such a degraded creature.’</p>

<p>Mr. Piper had to supplicate before Bella would
accept his offer of a hundred guinea horse. He did
not actually go down on his knees, but he humiliated
himself to the uttermost, and the dinner, which had
been perilled by his late return, was spoiled by this
extra delay.</p>

<p>This was the end of Mr. Piper’s first attempt at
self-assertion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">CAPTAIN STANDISH CHOOSES A HORSE.</span></p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Having</span> gained her point, and secured the promise
of a saddle-horse, Bella wasted no time in getting
herself ready to ride him. She was far too wise a
little woman to exhibit herself publicly on horseback,
before she had learned how to ride. She drove to
Great Yafford early next morning, was measured for
a habit by the best tailor in the town, and from the
tailor’s went to a riding school in the suburbs, where
the daughters of the plutocracy learned to sit straight
in their saddles, and to take desperate leaps over a
pole two feet from the tan floor.</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Piper arrived early enough to attire
herself in a borrowed riding-habit, and to get an
hour’s private lesson before the daily class began.</p>

<p>‘It is so very long since I’ve ridden,’ she said to
the master—a being of hybrid aspect, in whom the
swing and swagger of the cavalry soldier was curiously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
mixed with the distinctive graces of the circus rider,
‘my husband is afraid I might feel nervous on horseback.’</p>

<p>‘Is it very long, ma’am?’ asked the master, with
a view to the selection of an animal of exceptional
docility.</p>

<p>‘Well, yes,’ said Bella, who, in her present stage
of being, had never ridden anything more dangerous
than a wooden rocking-horse. ‘It is rather a long
time.’</p>

<p>‘Tame Cat,’ roared the master to his subordinate,
and in about five minutes a horse of nondescript
appearance—the kind of animal which seems to be
grown on purpose for riding-masters and flymen—a
creature with a straight neck, splay feet, and a rat tail,
but gifted with an expression of patient longsuffering
which, from a moral point of view, atoned for his
want of beauty.</p>

<p>Bella was mounted on Tame Cat, the master
mounted a tall ugly chestnut with a white blaze on his
face, and the two horses began to circumambulate
the barn-like building at a solemn walk. Then came
the exciting canter, and then the mathematical trot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
which was for first too much for even Bella’s natural
aptitude at doing everything she particularly wanted
to do. At the end of the hour, however, there was a
marked improvement, and the master complimented
his new pupil.</p>

<p>‘You were a good deal out of practice, ma’am,’
he said, ‘but you’ll get into it again nicely in a
dozen lessons.’</p>

<p>‘I shall come every morning for a week,’ said
Bella, ‘and you must teach me as much as you can
in the shortest possible time. Suppose I were to
take a double lesson, two hours instead of one.’</p>

<p>‘You might find it too fatiguing.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t mind fatigue a bit,’ answered Bella,
curiously forgetful of her depressed state of health.
‘I shall take a two hours’ lesson to-morrow. But,
remember, you are not to tell anybody about my
coming here. It seems so foolish for a person of my
age to be taking riding lessons.’</p>

<p>‘Lor’ bless your heart, ma’am, there’s ladies that
come here old enough to be your grandmother. You
should see them go round in the canter, with their
poor old elbows waggling.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span></p>

<p>For six days Bella pursued this secret course of
instruction. She contrived to have particular business
in Great Yafford every morning. Once she
went to carry a hamper of good things to the dear
girls at Miss Turk’s, twice to her dressmaker,
once to her milliner, once to change books at the
library, once to make an early call upon Mrs. Wigzell.</p>

<p>Mr. Piper accompanied her sometimes, but she
dropped him at his club, and he in no way interfered
with her liberty. At the end of the week the habit
was sent home from the tailor’s, and Bella had
learned to ride. She had jumped the pole successfully
at its greatest altitude, and it seemed to her
simple soul that there was nothing she could not
achieve in the hunting-field. She had learned to
sit straight, to keep her right shoulder back, to trot
easily round a corner. The riding-master dismissed
her with an assurance that she was a first-rate horse-woman,
which he could very well afford to do, as
she had paid him a guinea a lesson and made him
a present at parting.</p>

<p>‘If you really mean me to have a horse, Mr.
Piper, I think Captain Standish would be kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
enough to choose one for me. You know what a
judge he is.’</p>

<p>‘I’ve heard people say as much,’ assented Piper,
‘and I must confess he rides and drives pretty tidy
cattle. But I don’t see why I shouldn’t choose your
horse myself. It will be my money that’ll have to
pay for it, not Captain Standish’s.’</p>

<p>‘My dear Mr. Piper, horses are so out of your
line. You might choose some big clumsy creature—very
handsome in his way, no doubt, like the Flemish
dray horses, but quite unsuited for me. And you
know when you bought the bays you never noticed
the splint in Juno’s fore-leg.’</p>

<p>‘It wasn’t my business,’ growled Mr. Piper. ‘I
paid for a vet’s opinion.’</p>

<p>‘Precisely, and got cheated in spite of him. Now
Captain Standish is not like a veterinary surgeon.
He’ll get no commission. You had better let him
choose a horse for me.’</p>

<p>‘Well, my dear, if you like him to do so I’ve no
objection. I’ve promised you a horse, and I won’t
go from my bargain. Come, I’ll tell you what I’ll
do. I’ll write you a cheque for a hundred, and you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
and Standish can settle the business between you.
If he’s clever enough to get a good horse for seventy-five,
you can spend the difference on a new gown.
You’re never tired of getting new gowns.’</p>

<p>Mr. Piper wrote the cheque and went his way,
with a mind untainted by jealousy. He trusted this
pretty young wife of his with the guardianship of his
honour, as implicitly as he had trusted homely middle-aged
Mrs. Piper the first. He knew that Bella was
not faultless. He was far from feeling perfect satisfaction
with all her ways. He knew that she was
spending his money like water. But the hideous
idea that she could dishonour him, were it only in
thought, had not yet poisoned his peace.</p>

<p>The cheque was written on a Thursday, and in
the afternoon Captain Standish appeared among the
commercial aristocracy who now recognised Mrs.
Piper’s Thursday afternoons as a pleasant way of
wasting a couple of hours, airing their self-importance,
and exercising their carriage horses.</p>

<p>‘Has Piper consented to your hunting this
season?’ asked the captain, eagerly.</p>

<p>He was just so much in love as to feel that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
hunting-field would be an arid waste without
Bella.</p>

<p>‘He has consented to my riding, and he has
given me a hundred pounds to buy a horse. Here is
the cheque, and if you really don’t mind the trouble
of choosing one——’</p>

<p>‘You shall have the handsomest horse in Yorkshire,’
said the captain, putting the cheque in his
waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>‘But a hundred pounds won’t be enough for that,
will it?’ asked Bella. ‘One hears of such extravagant
prices being given for horses now-a-days.’</p>

<p>‘It will be quite enough, as I shall manage.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, you are so clever about horse-flesh. Our
coachman says the horses you ride are something
wonderful.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t ride screws,’ said the captain, with a
well-satisfied air.</p>

<p>He had a lofty pity for the poor creatures who
had to ride anything they could get, and be thankful,
and to dress themselves respectably upon something
under that eight hundred a year which Brummel
declared to be the lowest amount upon which a
gentleman could clothe himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span></p>

<p>Early in the next week Bella received a little
note from the captain, written at one of his London
clubs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>
‘Dear and liege lady,’—<br />
</p>

<p>‘I have bought you a perfect hunter, the gem of
Sir Lionel Hawtree’s stud, sold at Tattersall’s this
afternoon. I shall bring him to you on Thursday
morning. Be ready for a preliminary canter in the
park. He is young, and full of playfulness, but
without an atom of vice. He is quite the handsomest
thing you ever saw—black as my hat, and with the
sinews of a gladiator, as light as an antelope, and as
strong as a lion. I long to see you mounted on him.</p>

<p>
‘Yours always,<br />
‘<span class="smcap">Stephen Standish</span>.’<br />
</p>

<p>Bella felt pleased, but slightly doubtful as to the
advantage of such a combination of strength, playfulness,
and agility. The horses she had ridden at
Mr. Hammerman’s Riding Academy had not been
given to playfulness. Nor did she feel sure that a
creature with gladiatorial sinews and leonine strength
would be altogether the nicest thing to ride. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
might be tired before he was. However, she was full
of pride at the idea of having a horse of such distinguished
beauty, and of being able to lord it over
the Miss Porkmans, who were very proud of their
horsemanship, and very fond of talking about their
hairbreadth ‘scapes and ventures, and how they had
taken it out of their horses, which, according to their
own account, were of a very wild and dangerous
breed. Bella had no doubt she would be able to
take it out of the black. She was glad he was black.
There is something so common about a bay. She
could hardly rest till Thursday morning came. She
went half-a-dozen times to the stables to see that
the black’s loose box was properly prepared, with its
fringes and decorations of plaited straw, and all the
newest improvements in stable fittings. She was
walking up and down the broad gravel drive in front
of the portico, when the captain appeared, riding his
handsome chestnut, followed by a groom, who led a
creature so clothed and knee-capped and hooded,
that nothing was visible but checked kerseymere.
He appeared, furthermore, to have a monstrous hump,
which gave him the appearance of a Bactrian camel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span></p>

<p>‘I should have ridden him over myself, but I
would not bring him to you with the dust of the
road upon him,’ said the captain, dismounting, and
shaking hands, a lingering hand-shake with a tender
little pressure at the end. ‘Now, Dobbs, off with
the clothes.’</p>

<p>The black was stripped in a minute or two, and
stood before them in all his beauty, a glossy-coated,
thoroughbred, finely moulded creature, with a backward
roll of his full eye, and an alert movement of his
delicate ear, common to horses of his high breeding.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t he perfect?’ asked the captain, contemplating
his purchase with the eye of pride.</p>

<p>‘He is lovely, and I don’t know how to thank
you,’ answered Bella, watching the black’s restless
eyeball; ‘but isn’t he dreadfully high-spirited? You
know I don’t pretend to be a Diana Vernon.’</p>

<p>‘You could not do anything badly if you tried,’
said the captain. ‘Don’t be alarmed. Erebus has a
lovely temper. With your light little hand on his
snaffle, and with a comfortable bit in his mouth, he’ll
go as gently as a Shetland pony.’</p>

<p>‘Is he called Erebus?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes, he was sold under that name. You can
change it if you like.’</p>

<p>‘No, I think it’s rather a good name,’ answered
Bella, patting Erebus’s velvet nose, a liberty which
he endured with perfect affability. ‘It isn’t
common.’</p>

<p>The Miss Porkmans’ horses were called Prince
and Daisy.</p>

<p>The cause of the hump-like appearance which
had puzzled Bella was a very handsome side-saddle
of quilted doeskin—quite the perfection of a saddle.</p>

<p>‘I ventured to have him measured for a saddle
directly I decided on buying him for you,’ explained
the captain. ‘The saddlers had to work day and
night to get it finished by yesterday evening. You
must please to accept the saddle as my humble
offering.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I really couldn’t,’ exclaimed Bella. ‘It’s
too good of you, but I’m sure Mr. Piper would not
allow——’</p>

<p>‘I’ll answer for Mr. Piper’s approval. And now
run and put on your habit, and try Erebus’s paces
over that smooth bit of turf.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span></p>

<p>Bella ran away and reappeared in about ten
minutes, looking the prettiest little huntress imaginable,
perfectly dressed from the top of her neat
chimney-pot to the point of her morocco boot. She
had forgotten nothing.</p>

<p>Captain Standish lifted her into the saddle, gave
her the reins, and then mounted by her side. They
walked quietly to the stretch of turf, and then and
there, the instant he felt the grass under his hoofs,
Erebus bolted with his light burden.</p>

<p>She sat him splendidly, feeling as if her last hour
were come. After making a wild circuit of a mile or
so, he consented to be pulled up, and stood looking
the image of innocence, when Captain Standish rode
slowly up to him.</p>

<p>‘I hope you didn’t think me cruel for not riding
after you,’ said the captain. ‘My horse would have
only made yours go faster. I saw you were mistress
of him. He suits you to a nicety. But you shouldn’t
indulge him with that kind of spurt often. It isn’t
good form.’</p>

<p>‘N—no,’ faltered Bella, who had no more control<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
over the black than she had over the hastening
clouds in the autumn sky.</p>

<p>‘Now we’ll go for a ride over the moor, and you
shall take it out of him,’ said the captain.</p>

<p>They went upon the moor, and the black took it
out of Bella, for she went home after a two hours
ride more exhausted than she had ever felt in her
life before.</p>

<p>There had been no opportunity even for the
captain to breathe the sweet poison of his unhallowed
love in his companion’s ear, although they
were alone together under the wide heaven. The
black had absorbed the attention of both. He was a
creature of infinite resources, and of as much variety
as the serpent of old Nile. They never knew what
he might be doing next.</p>

<p>‘Do you really think I shall be able to hunt with
him?’ asked Bella, when she dismounted, faint and
exhausted, at her own door.</p>

<p>‘I’m sure of it. You have a first-rate seat. It’s
only your hands that want a little more education.
When we have had half-a-dozen rides together you
will be able to do what you like with Erebus. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
would not have bought him for you if there had been
an atom of vice in him. But before you ride him to
hounds I’ll hunt him a day or two myself, and see
how he takes his fences.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps that would be best,’ said Bella. ‘Mr.
Piper is so nervous about my riding. Certainly,
Erebus is a most lovely creature. He must be very
cheap for a hundred pounds.’</p>

<p>‘Well, yes,’ said the captain, smiling, ‘he may
fairly be called a bargain—at that price.’</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">VANESSA’S VISIT.</span></p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Erebus</span> was in due course shown to Mr. Piper, who
knew so little about horses as to be scarcely worthy
to be called a Yorkshireman. His own particular
vanity in the way of horse-flesh was a fast pony
that could trot between the shafts of a light carriage
for any number of hours without rest or refreshment.
Anything beyond that was out of his line.
He contemplated the black with a cool survey, and
thought that there was very little of him for the
money.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t he lovely?’ asked Bella, patting the
creature’s sleek neck.</p>

<p>Erebus was of a heavenly temper in his stable.
It was only when conscious of humanity on his back
that he was subject to fits of waywardness.</p>

<p>‘Well, he aren’t bad-looking,’ assented the unenthusiastic
Piper; ‘but if I’d chose a horse for you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
I should have picked one with more timber and a
better back for the saddle. I hope he’s quiet.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, he’s everything that’s nice,’ answered
Bella, with a fluttering of her heart at the recollection
of some of Erebus’s manœuvres that morning.
‘I shall feel as easy on him as in an arm-chair—when
I get used to him.’</p>

<p>‘And Captain Standish gave you a riding lesson,
did he?’ inquired Mr. Piper.</p>

<p>‘Yes, he went over the moor with me, just
to show me how to manage Erebus.’</p>

<p>‘That was very civil of him. But you mustn’t
be riding about with him often, you know, Bella.
It wouldn’t do. You mean no harm, and he means
no harm. I know that, my dear. But it would
set people talking—and I’m as proud a man as
Cæsar in my way. I won’t have my wife talked
about.’</p>

<p>Bella buried her pale face in the black’s silky
mane. She did not care to meet her husband’s
honest eyes just at this particular moment.</p>

<p>‘I would not for the world do anything you
dislike,’ she said, meekly; ‘but I want to learn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
how to manage Erebus, and I don’t think any one
could teach me so well as Captain Standish. And,
by and by, when the foxhunting begins, if you did
not mind, I should like very much to—to——’
Here Mr. Piper glared at her with a look so awful
that she remodelled the end of her sentence—’ to
see the hounds throw off.’</p>

<p>‘You could drive to the meet in your pony
chay,’ said Mr. Piper. ‘Nobody could say there
was harm in that.’</p>

<p>‘It would be much nicer to go on horseback,’
pleaded Bella, laying her little white hand caressingly
on Mr. Piper’s velvet collar.</p>

<p>‘Why, what a baby you are, little woman!’ he
exclaimed, mollified by that light touch, and the
coaxing look in the Dresden china face. ‘Yon
horse is a new toy. You’ll be wanting to ride him
into the drawing-room, I shouldn’t wonder, or to
have him lying on the hearth-rug of a winter
evening, like a Newfoundland.’</p>

<p>This, in Bella’s idea, meant permission to go to
the meet, and once at the meet it would be very
easy to follow the hounds for half an hour or so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
and to declare afterwards that it was Erebus’s doing,
quite an involuntary bit of hunting on her own part.
Bella was past mistress of those small arts by
which an adroit unscrupulous woman manages to
get her own way.</p>

<p>‘I’ll tell you what,’ said Mr. Piper presently,
‘if you want to have company when you’re out
riding, you’d better ask one of Porkman’s girls to
come and spend a week with you and bring her
hoss. They’re first-rate horsewomen, both of ’em.’</p>

<p>‘I should be very glad to have Vanessa,’ said
Bella. ‘I think she’s the nicest—or, at any rate,
the least nasty,’ she added hastily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Porkman was a woman gifted with dim
and uncultured aspirations after the beautiful. She
had filled her drawing-room with heterogeneous
bric-a-brac, including every variety of bad art, from
Cleopatra’s needle in Cornish serpentine to the
latest monstrosity in Bohemian glass, and she had
called her two eldest daughters Stella and Vanessa,
having read of two young women of that name once
in a book. She had forgotten all about the book,
and the young women, but the names had lingered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
in her memory. She had her eldest daughter christened
Stella, and in due time there appeared a
Vanessa to complete the pair, and to take to Stella’s
cast-off frocks.</p>

<p>Bella thought it would not be altogether inconvenient—nay,
it would be very convenient—to
have Vanessa Porkman for her companion. With
Vanessa riding on her left side, Captain Standish
might ride on her right, without giving occasion for
scandal. She was not at all afraid of Vanessa being
scandalized by anything she saw or heard. The
second Miss Porkman was so far in advance of her
age, that she had in a manner anticipated all the
feminine fastness of the nineteenth century. The
skating rink, the ladies’ club of the future, contained
nothing calculated to shock Vanessa.</p>

<p>Miss Porkman accepted Mrs. Piper’s invitation
gladly. She owned with a charming candour that
she was always glad to get away from home.
She was quite open-minded in her contempt for her
own family, and never even pretended to think
them refined or well-bred. ‘Papa is simply
dreadful,’ she would declare frankly. ‘I quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
wonder how any of us put up with him. I suppose
it is only because he is the family banker. If he
wasn’t, we should put him in the gardener’s barrow
and wheel him down to the edge of the river, and
topple him comfortably in, and get rid of him as
quietly as the gentle Hindoos do of their parents
when they’ve lived long enough.’</p>

<p>Miss Porkman came. She was a florid young
woman, with bold brown eyes, an affectation of short
sight, an eye-glass, and an insatiable thirst for masculine
society. Contemplated from an abstract ethnological
point of view, she was a remarkably interesting
example of the depth of deterioration to which the
womanly character can descend among the well-to-do
classes; but she was an excruciating young
woman to live with.</p>

<p>In her mind the business of a woman’s life was
flirtation. To be admired, to agitate the hearts of
men, to lure the luckless Strephon from his legitimate
Chloe, these things, in Miss Porkman’s mind,
constituted woman’s mission. She was not strong-minded,
she was no eager reformer, she didn’t care
twopence about universal suffrage; but she wanted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
to be the Cleopatra of her small world, to have
Cæsar, and Pompey, and Antonius, and the young
Augustus, and every man of them subjugated and
adoring. She had unlimited confidence in her own
good looks, and a scornful pity for plain women, with
whom nobody cared to flirt.</p>

<p>The fair Vanessa had tried her hardest to entangle
Captain Standish in those flowery chains
which she kept in stock for all eligible victims,
but the captain had not allowed himself to be
bound. She had seen with disgust that he was a
constant guest at the Park, and that he lavished
upon Bella those attentions which she had herself
unsuccessfully invited. To flirt with a married
woman was in Miss Porkman’s eyes not so much
immoral as it was cowardly. She would have
excused the immorality, but she could not forgive
the cowardice. Here was evidently a man who
feared to trust himself within the range of her
charms, lest he should be caught unawares and
meshed in the matrimonial net, and who amused
himself with a vapid flirtation in a quarter where
he felt himself ignobly safe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span></p>

<p>‘He can’t care for such a little waxen image
as Mrs. Piper,’ said Miss Porkman, contemplating
her Juno-like figure in her cheval-glass, ‘but he
doesn’t want to marry into the commercial classes,
and he’s afraid to trust himself with <i>me</i>.’</p>

<p>Vanessa came to Little Yafford Park, resolved
to leave it a conqueror. She brought her prettiest
dresses. She brought her horse, and she believed herself
invincible on horseback. If Captain Standish
was as much at the Park as report said he was,
Vanessa felt sure of victory.</p>

<p>She was not disappointed. Captain Standish
came every day, and rode every day on the moor
with Bella and Miss Porkman. He taught Bella
how to manage the black, and he was sufficiently attentive
to Vanessa to keep that young lady in perpetual
good humour with herself and him.</p>

<p>Bella’s pluck, which was undeniable, made up
in a great measure for her want of experience. In
a week she was mistress of Erebus, and seemed
well able to cope with his whims and uncertainties,
his disposition to take fright at shadows, and to bolt
on every inconvenient occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span></p>

<p>‘I never knew any one learn to ride so quickly,’
said the captain, ‘for upon my word, you know,
frankly, you knew very little about it when you
first rode Erebus.’</p>

<p>Bella blushed, remembering how little she had
known, how much less even than the captain gave
her credit for knowing.</p>

<p>Mr. Piper saw them start for their ride sometimes,
and was pleased to see his little woman
happy. He could see no harm in her accepting
the captain’s escort while she had Vanessa Porkman
with her, an expensively educated, well brought up
young woman, who knew what was what, and
would be sure to keep Captain Standish in his
place. He praised the black, and thanked the
captain for buying that accomplished animal.</p>

<p>‘He’s rather too weedy for my style,’ said Mr.
Piper, ‘but he looks well-bred, and he carries my
little woman beautifully.’</p>

<p>Captain Standish dined at the Park twice during
the week, at Mr. Piper’s particular invitation.</p>

<p>‘Do you know, Bella,’ said Ebenezer, one night,
after Miss Porkman had lighted her candle and left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
them, ‘I think Standish is smitten with Vanessa. I
shouldn’t wonder if it was to be a match. She’s
an uncommon fine girl, and old Porkman could give
her twenty thousand and feel none the poorer for
it. She wouldn’t be a bad catch for the captain.’</p>

<p>‘Catch!’ echoed Bella, contemptuously. ‘Do you
suppose Captain Standish wants what you call a
catch? Do you think he would care to take Mr.
Porkman’s twenty thousand pounds, and go down
to the grave associated with provisions? Captain
Standish could not afford to marry Vanessa if he
loved her to distraction. Whenever he marries he
must marry rank. You forget that his mother is
Lady Emmeline Standish.’</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t,’ said Mr. Piper. ‘But I can’t see
that his mother’s having a handle to her name need
make Porkman’s money less acceptable. Money
can buy land, can’t it? and, in England, land means
aristocracy. Put your money into the soil, and
you’re an aristocrat. That’s how I take it. I
should never have bought this place, to pay me
two and a half per cent., if I hadn’t felt that I was
hooking myself on to the landed gentry. I say,’ concluded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
Mr. Piper, spreading his coat tails as he
stood with his portly back to the fire, ‘I say that
Vanessa Porkman would be a capital match for
Standish, and he’s a fool if he can’t see it.’</p>

<p>‘Pray don’t take up Mrs. Dulcimer’s craze of
match-making,’ said Bella, scornfully.</p>

<p>She was indignant at the idea that any one
could suppose Captain Standish in love with
Vanessa—that large middle-class Juno.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Dulcimer’s good-natured soul was
perturbed by Vanessa’s visit. She went to the
Park on Thursday afternoon, and remonstrated with
Bella for her short-sightedness and want of sisterly
feeling.</p>

<p>‘My dear, you are letting that horrid Miss
Porkman cut out poor Clementina,’ she complained.
‘This visit of hers will quite spoil Clementina’s
chance with Captain Standish.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, Mrs. Dulcimer, Tina never had any
chance with Captain Standish. He is not a marrying
man. I have heard him say as much.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, my dear, they all say that, and even think
it until they are caught. It doesn’t make the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
slightest difference. I am sure he admired your
sister, and it would have been such a splendid
match for her, and so nice for you to have had such
aristocratic connections. Lady Emmeline would
have been your—something in-law. And now
you have spoiled it all by inviting Miss Porkman.’</p>

<p>‘I wanted some one to ride with me,’ said
Bella. ‘Clementina can’t ride, and hasn’t a horse.’</p>

<p>‘Well, it is a great pity. Everybody says that
Captain Standish is in love with Miss Porkman.’</p>

<p>Bella knew that Mrs. Dulcimer’s everybody
usually meant herself and Rebecca.</p>

<p>And now the time drew near for Bella to try her
fortune in the hunting-field. She sounded Miss
Porkman, and found that young lady eager for anything
fast and furious. Vanessa had never hunted—Mr.
Porkman objecting to ladies in the field just
as strongly as Mr. Piper. But she was quite ready to
hazard the paternal anger, supposing it impossible to
have a day’s sport without her father coming to hear
of it.</p>

<p>‘He has never actually forbidden us to hunt,’
said Vanessa, ‘but I know he doesn’t like ladies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
riding to hounds. I’ve heard him say so very often.
However, he won’t know anything about it till it’s
all over, and when he does hear of it I must weather
the storm somehow.’</p>

<p>Vanessa had weathered a good many paternal
tempests since she had emerged from the nursery,
stormy winds blown up by milliner’s bills, hurricanes
provoked by too reckless flirtations, and divers other
meteorological disturbances of a domestic nature. A
storm, more or less, in Vanessa’s opinion made no
difference.</p>

<p>Captain Standish rode the black to hounds, and
pronounced him perfect.</p>

<p>‘There’s to be a grand meet next Thursday morning
at Milvey Bridge, and we must all go,’ he said,
to Bella. ‘You can tell Piper you are going to see
the hounds throw off.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">OPENING HIS EYES.</span></p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">While</span> Bella had been indulging in archery, dinner-giving,
riding, and other expensive amusements,
her husband’s old friend and servant, Samuel Chumney,
had returned from his fortnight’s holiday, and
had taken his place among those insignificant and unvalued
guests whom the mistress of the Park regarded
rather as lookers on, or as a kind of human furniture,
than as actual participators in her gaieties and
pleasures.</p>

<p>On her Thursday afternoons Mrs. Piper tolerated
Chumney, as a necessary evil. His old-fashioned
shirt-collars were ridiculous, but harmless. He was
quiet, and was therefore much less vulgar than the
prosperous Porkman or the millionaire Timperley.
So, as it pleased Mr. Piper to have him there, Bella
endured his presence without further complaint.</p>

<p>‘As long as you don’t invite him to my best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
dinners I don’t mind,’ she told Mr. Piper, which
was certainly a great concession from a young lady
who, a year or so before, had not always been sure
of having any dinner at all.</p>

<p>Mr. Chumney looked on at Bella’s career, and
had his own opinion about her, and said nothing.
Miss Coyle said a great deal to him, and he let her
talk, but he never committed himself by any more
direct expression of opinion than was to be gleaned
from a grave nod, or a significant shake of the head.
This dumb show of his, and the general reticence of
his manners, possessed a wonderful fascination for
Miss Coyle. She opened her mind to him freely,
and felt herself in the presence of supreme worldly
wisdom.</p>

<p>‘If poor Mr. Piper were only like you, that
foolish young woman would not venture upon such
conduct,’ said Miss Coyle, whereupon Mr. Chumney
lifted his dark eyebrows, and thrust his fingers into
his waistcoat pockets, and breathed a gentle sigh.</p>

<p>‘Spending all her mornings riding about with that
Captain Standish, a man of notoriously dissipated
character,’ said Miss Coyle, who knew as much about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
the captain as she did about the inhabitants of the
moon.</p>

<p>‘Ha!’ groaned Mr. Chumney, as if in assent to a
general proposition which he could not confute.</p>

<p>‘And making a bosom friend of that flashy Miss
Porkman, while she neglects her own sisters. Birds
of a feather——’</p>

<p>‘Flock together,’ concluded Mr. Chumney, venturing
to commit himself so far.</p>

<p>‘How it is that Mr. Piper doesn’t see what is
going on under his very nose is more than I can
imagine.’</p>

<p>‘Piper is a man in a thousand, madam,’ said
Mr. Chumney.</p>

<p>‘But so foolishly confiding. Ah, Mr. Chumney, it
is trying to see the present state of things, after
having had the privilege of knowing the first Mrs.
Piper.’</p>

<p>‘True,’ sighed Chumney.</p>

<p>‘How different her habits were! She was a
woman of real piety, equally anxious about this
world and the next.’</p>

<p>‘She never could keep her cook,’ said Chumney,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
doubtfully. ‘I have seen worse cooking at Piper’s
table than ever I saw in my own humble lodging.’</p>

<p>‘Poor Mrs. Piper was not fortunate with her
servants,’ assented Miss Coyle, ‘but then she was
such a good manager. No waste or riot in her time.
How self-denying she was! To my own knowledge
she rarely discarded a silk gown till it had been
turned twice.’</p>

<p>Miss Coyle knew very little and talked a great
deal. Mr. Chumney knew a great deal and held his
peace, waiting, with masterly patience, until the
time should come for him to speak. For the last
three months he had taken upon himself the office
of a private inquirer, without fee or reward. He
had made it his business to find out all that was to
be known about Captain Standish. He had gone
into all manner of company in order to make these
discoveries, but his informants had been chiefly
of the back-stairs—grooms, valets, tailors, boot-makers,
horse dealers, people of all grades, who
had been honoured with the captain’s custom or
patronage.</p>

<p>The result of his inquiries showed that Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
Standish was an unscrupulous, unprincipled man—a
man who paid his way, simply because he had plenty
of money wherewith to gratify his desires, but who
did not shrink from a dishonourable act, or hesitate
at a baseness, where dishonourable, or base, dealing
could further his aims. He had contrived in a brief
career to do as much mischief as would have earned
for a young nobleman a handsome reputation, in the
days when men wore powder and patches, and considered
iniquity a distinction. Another man in Samuel
Chumney’s position might have made an immediate
use of his knowledge, and let his friend know the
kind of person he had admitted to his house; but
Mr. Chumney preferred to wait for some crushing
proof of the captain’s unworthiness, and he was not
disinclined to let Bella proceed far enough in her
folly to disenchant her husband.</p>

<p>‘It will give Piper the whip-hand over her for
the rest of his days,’ he thought, ‘if he finds her out
in a compromising flirtation with this fellow
Standish.’</p>

<p>This was the condition of affairs up to the
evening before the foxhunt, when Mr. Chumney,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
through one of his horsey informants, became acquainted
with the history of Captain Standish’s
purchase of the black called Erebus. This piece of
information he considered it his duty to impart to
Mr. Piper, without loss of time, so he walked over to
Little Yafford next morning for that purpose.</p>

<p>It was the last day of October, and a lovely morning.
The wind was in the south, a wind so balmy
and gentle, that it only caressed the red and golden
foliage, and hardly scattered the leaves. Here and
there a withered leaf dropped lazily down from the
dark brown branches, wet and shining with autumnal
dew. The grass beside the road glistened in the
morning light. A veil of vapour shrouded the
hills, and gave a look of mystery to the distant landscape.
Now and then a gleam of sunshine pierced
the mist, brightening and warming all things, and
then all was gray again.</p>

<p>‘A fine morning for the hounds,’ said a passing
rustic by way of salutation, but Samuel Chumney
responded only with a sulky nod. He did not care
for the hounds. He looked upon all field sports as
waste and foolishness, and considered it man’s proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
avocation all over the world to sit upon a high stool
in a counting-house and add up columns of figures.
He felt a half-scornful tolerance for soldiers and
sailors, as needed to protect commerce, and defend
the rights of the men who sat in counting-houses.
But for all other grades of humanity he had only
contempt.</p>

<p>Even for Mr. Chumney’s long legs it was a two
hours’ walk from the town to the village, so, although
he had started directly after his breakfast, it
was nearly eleven o’clock when he arrived at the
Park. Mr. Piper was walking up and down the lawn
in front of his drawing-room windows, smoking his
morning cigar.</p>

<p>‘Holloa, Chum,’ he exclaimed, ‘what wind blows
you this way? Come over to have a look at the
farm, have you? The pigs are doing beautifully.
I feel pretty sure of a prize for some of ’em. It’s as
much as they can do to stand already. Take anything
after your walk? No? Well, I know what a
sober old file you are. Come round and have a look
at the pigs.’</p>

<p>Mr. Piper put his arm through Chumney’s, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
led him towards the farm, which was shut off from
the park and gardens by shrubberies and a fir plantation.</p>

<p>‘Hang your pigs!’ cried Chumney. ‘To my eye
a prize pig is the most hideous object in creation.
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
ought to interfere. They’re down upon a costermonger
for over-driving his donkey, but they don’t
say a word against a nobleman for making an
animal’s existence a slow martyrdom, by gorging it
with oil-cake until its legs refuse to carry the weight
of its overfed carcass.’</p>

<p>Mr. Piper, elated with the anticipation of a prize
at the Christmas Cattle Show, was in no humour to
give ear to the voice of humanity on the lips of his
old cashier.</p>

<p>‘Come and have a look at the pigs, Chum, and
don’t you take to preaching sermons in your old age.
It ain’t oil-cake either, old boy. It’s milk and meal,
and the pork will eat as tender as a chicken and as
mellow as a William pear. Do you suppose the
animals are unhappy? Not a bit of it. They’re no
more unhappy than an alderman who over-eats himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
with turtle and venison. And as to their not
being able to stand, why, I’ve seen Porkman and
Timperley many a time after dinner when they’ve
not been able to stand, and they were as happy as
lords.’</p>

<p>They had arrived at the pigsties by this time,
and Mr. Chumney was regaled with the sight of
various mountains of pinky flesh, out of whose
tremulous bulk issued smothered gruntings as a sole
indication of life. Here and there something like an
ear was to be seen pendent from a hillock of bristly
pinkness, but Mr. Chumney looked in vain for an
eye. The organs of sight had disappeared under
pendulous ridges of fat.</p>

<p>‘You may call that an improving exhibition,’ protested
Chumney. ‘I don’t. And now if you will
withdraw your mind from your pigs for five or ten
minutes, I’ve got something serious to say to you.’</p>

<p>‘Serious?’ exclaimed Mr. Piper. ‘Another failure
in the wool trade, I suppose. Well, thank goodness,
they can’t touch me. My money is safe.’</p>

<p>‘I’m not going to talk about your money.
Where’s Mrs. Piper?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span></p>

<p>‘Gone for a ride with Vanessa Porkman.’</p>

<p>‘And Captain Standish, I suppose.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, the captain was with them. He keeps a
couple of horses at the “Crown,” so as to be handy for
the hunting. They’re going to see the hounds throw
off at Milvey Bridge. I think the captain’s sweet
upon Vanessa. It would be a very good match for
him, and I know the Porkmans would jump at it.
But my little woman says no. The Porkmans aren’t
good enough for him.’</p>

<p>They had turned out of the farmyard into the
plantation, a pleasant place for a morning walk and
a friendly chat. The ground was carpeted with fir
needles, and Mr. Piper had trodden for himself a
narrow track under the trees, while he smoked his
after-breakfast cigar.</p>

<p>‘Now, old Chum,’ he said. ‘Nobody can overhear
us here. Say your say. It’s something about
yourself, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘No, it isn’t. It’s something about you. Now,
I think you know that I’ve always looked up to you
and honoured you, that I’d go through fire and water
for you—real fire, and real water.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes, I know that. Go on.’</p>

<p>‘Now I don’t like to see the man I honour putting
himself in a false position, as you are doing every day
you tolerate this fellow Standish’s attentions to your
wife.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be a fool!’ cried Mr. Piper, angrily. ‘Do
you suppose I don’t know how to take care of my
wife? She likes to have Standish here, because he’s
the fashion, and everybody runs after him. I like
her to have him here for the same reason. The
Porkmans and the Timperleys would give their eyes
to be as intimate with Captain Standish as we are;
but they haven’t the knack of making their houses
pleasant to a man of his stamp. Bella has. She’s
spent my money pretty fast, but I don’t begrudge it
to her, for she’s given me a position in society that
I never had in Moggie’s time, and I’m not too proud
to own it. Don’t you come here to insinuate anything
against my wife, Chumney, or you and me will
cease to know each other,’ concluded Mr. Piper, with
dignity.</p>

<p>He was incensed with Chumney, but he was not
in the slightest degree moved by what Chumney had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
said. His faith in Bella was rooted deeply. It was
intertwined with his faith in himself, and that was
invincible.</p>

<p>‘I couldn’t be jealous if I tried,’ he said. ‘My
self-respect wouldn’t allow me.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t want you to be jealous, but I want you
to respect yourself,’ answered Chumney. ‘I might
have spoken sooner, perhaps, but I waited till I had
good grounds for speaking. First and foremost, I’ve
found out all about Captain Standish. He’s a bad
lot.’</p>

<p>‘He’s received everywhere in the highest society.’</p>

<p>‘There are a good many bad lots going about in
high society, without any brand upon ’em either.
He’s not a man I’d receive in my house, if I had a
house.’</p>

<p>‘But you haven’t, you see,’ said Piper, testily.
‘That makes all the difference. Perhaps if you
had a big house like this, and wanted to fill it
with pleasant people, you’d lower your standard
of morality a bit. It’s all very well for Diogenes
to be particular about what company he keeps. He’s
only got his tub to fill, and he can fill that himself.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span></p>

<p>‘Don’t let’s beat about the bush, Piper. Would
you like your wife to receive a present—something
to the tune of a couple of hundred pounds—from
such a man as Captain Standish?’</p>

<p>‘I wouldn’t let her receive such a present
from any man alive, and she knows it. Her own
sense must tell her,’ exclaimed Piper, getting
warm.</p>

<p>‘You can’t always trust to a woman’s sense,
particularly when she’s young and pretty,’ said
the cynical Chumney. ‘I say your wife has received
such a present—though I’ll give her the
benefit of the doubt, and say she doesn’t know
anything about it,—and by so doing has made
you and herself the talk of the Great Yafford
club.’</p>

<p>‘What present?’ asked Piper, pale with rage.</p>

<p>‘The horse she rides.’</p>

<p>‘That’s the biggest lie that’s been told at the
club for a long time, though I’ve known ’em to
tell some jolly big ones there. The horse my
wife rides was given to her by me. I wrote a
cheque for a hundred pounds, and put it in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
hand. All Standish did was to choose the horse
at Tattersall’s.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think such a horse as that is to be
bought for a hundred pounds? Your friends at
the club know all about the horse. It was the
gem of Sir Lionel Hawtree’s stud, and sold for
three hundred and thirty guineas. The difference
between your cheque and the auction price was
a gift from Captain Standish to your wife. You
have boasted of getting Erebus for a hundred
pounds, and have been laughed at by men who
know all about the horse. I had heard some
queer things said, but I only learned the real state
of the case last night.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe it,’ exclaimed Piper. ‘Why
should Captain Standish spend his money on a
horse for my wife?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know why, but I know he has done
it,’ returned Chumney. ‘Read that!’</p>

<p>He handed Mr. Piper a cutting from <i>Bell’s Life</i>.</p>

<p>‘That’s from a paper two Sundays old,’ he said,
‘but I only got it last night.’</p>

<p>It was the description of a sale of hunters at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
Tattersall’s. The following paragraph was marked
at the side in red ink:—</p>

<p>‘One of the gems of the stud was Erebus, a
lady’s hack, fifteen two, rising six, black, without
a white hair about him, and perfect in every
point. This horse was knocked down to Captain
Standish, at three hundred and thirty guineas,
after a lively competition.’</p>

<p>‘How do I know it is the same horse he
bought for my wife?’ asked Mr. Piper, when he
had read the paragraph.</p>

<p>‘I don’t see much room for doubt. It’s neither
a common name nor a common colour. Of course
there may be no particular harm in a man spending
his money to eke out your gift to your wife,
but I think it puts you in a false position.’</p>

<p>‘Think!’ roared Mr. Piper. ‘It puts me in a
position that will oblige me to kick Captain Standish
out of my house; and if I thought my wife
knew it—knew that she was riding a horse bought
with that man’s money—I would shut my doors
upon her as readily as upon him. I may be a
fool about Bella, but I’m only a fool within certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
limits. There are bounds, Chumney—bounds
that I shan’t overstep. But I don’t believe she
knows it—no, she could not be so ungrateful—she
could not be so base as to degrade me in any
man’s eyes—after my lavishing my money upon
her—picking her out of the gutter to make a
duchess of her—giving her an honest man’s love
into the bargain. No, I can believe anything of
that fellow’s audacity, but nothing against her.
Don’t ask me to think ill of her.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t,’ said Chumney; ‘but I think it’s
high time this philandering with Captain Standish
should be put a stop to, and I fancy I’ve shown
you a good reason for stopping it. I hope you don’t
think I’ve gone beyond my duty as a friend.’</p>

<p>‘No, Chumney, no; you have done your duty,
and I shall do mine. The horse shall go back
to Standish’s stable this afternoon, and Standish
shall never cross my threshold again. But if you
hear men talk of this at the club, be sure you
tell them that my wife knew nothing about it.
She has been the victim of a fop’s impertinence—that’s
all.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span></p>

<p>‘I will, Mr. Piper. You may be sure of that.’</p>

<p>‘And now you’d better make yourself scarce,
Chumney. I’d rather be alone when my wife comes
home from her ride.’</p>

<p>‘You won’t be violent!’ urged Mr. Chumney.</p>

<p>‘No, Chumney, I am too angry to be violent.
If I laid my little finger upon Standish it would
mean murder. I feel it in me to do something
dreadful. Don’t you be frightened, Chum. I shall
treat him with the utmost civility. I shall only
let him understand that his little game is found
out. Good-bye.’</p>

<p>Mr. Chumney would have preferred to remain.
He had an idea that his friend wanted him, in
this crisis of his domestic life; but Mr. Piper
thought otherwise, and was too resolute a man to
allow himself to be overruled. So Chumney
went away, unrefreshed and disheartened. He did
not go back to Great Yafford immediately, but
stopped at the “Crown” to regale himself with a
temperate luncheon of bread and cheese and ale.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">A SHORT RECKONING.</span></p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">When</span> Chumney was gone Ebenezer Piper walked
up and down the narrow track in the pine plantation,
ruminating upon what he had been told.
Why should any man, however princely in his
ideas, make a gift of two hundred and thirty
guineas to another man’s wife? Such a thing
could hardly happen, without implying evil design
in the giver. Bella might be innocent, but this
man was guilty. This gift of the horse was one
act of many, all tending towards a villanous conclusion.</p>

<p>And then there came back upon Mr. Piper’s
mind the whole history of his wife’s acquaintance
with Captain Standish—how this man, whose
reputation had been made by an insolent exclusiveness,
had been, from his introduction at the
Park, a constant visitor. Mr. Piper had been flattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
by this distinction, and had ascribed Captain
Standish’s preference to an Epicurean appreciation
of his fine house, and an intellectual pleasure in
his conversation.</p>

<p>Now, all at once, he saw the past in a new light,
and knew that he had been blind, and deaf, and
foolish. Bella’s pretty face had been the attraction;
Bella’s winning manners had been the lure.</p>

<p>‘If I thought that she had encouraged him,
knowing his drift, if I knew that she had been
false to me by so much as one erring thought, I
would have done with her at once and for ever.
She owes me too much. No, it is impossible. It
isn’t in human nature to be so base. And that
pretty little smiling face of hers—no, that could
not lie.’</p>

<p>This was how he argued with himself. Yet
there was no assurance in his mind. His self-respect
was strong still, his belief in his own
claims and merits still unshaken; but there had
appeared to him a vision of a phenomenal falsehood,
a preternatural iniquity in woman.</p>

<p>‘If he spent his money for that horse, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
accepted the gift knowingly, it was not his first
gift,’ he said to himself. ‘There have been letters
passing between them, perhaps. I’ll search her
room, and if I find one shred of evidence against
her she shall stand condemned. I’ll have no half-measures.
Either she’s my true and honest wife,
or she’s—something that shall have no shelter
under my roof. She must be all or nothing to me.’</p>

<p>He went back to the house.</p>

<p>‘Has your missus come back?’ he asked the
footman idling in the hall.</p>

<p>‘No, sir.’</p>

<p>It was nearly three o’clock, long past the usual
hour for luncheon. Mr. Piper passed the open
doorway of the dining-room, through which he
could see the table laid for the mid-day meal, with
that modern elegance and glow of colour which
Bella had substituted for the commonplace arrangements
that had obtained before her time. He went
upstairs with a heavy step, and walked straight to
his wife’s boudoir. It was a gem of a room at the
end of the corridor, with a large bow-window overlooking
the garden, a room bright with all the luxuries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
and frivolities the second Mrs. Piper had accumulated
during her brief reign, buhl, Sèvre, ormolu,
tortoiseshell, ivory, malachite, celadon, turquoise,
rose Du Barry, every colour and every substance,
rosebud chintz, old lace, a carpet of velvet pile.</p>

<p>Mr. Piper, standing at gaze and breathing his
hardest, in the centre of this crowded toy-shop-room,
looked very like the traditional bull in the
china-shop, and an infuriated bull to boot. He
had come there with a purpose, but for the moment
he paused irresolute. He felt ashamed of himself
for doubting his wife ever so little. The sight of
this room reassured him.</p>

<p>‘Didn’t I give her every one of these things?’ he
said to himself. ‘How can she help being fond of me?’</p>

<p>And then, just at that moment, his eye lighted
upon something which he had not given her. A
Parian statuette, on a black marble base, Danneker’s
famous Ariadne.</p>

<p>‘No, I didn’t give her that,’ he said, ‘and it
wasn’t among her wedding presents. That’s something
from <i>him</i>.’</p>

<p>The table was covered with books. He took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
up one in cream-coloured calf, gilt edged, tooled, an
exquisite specimen of Riviere’s binding—Alfred de
Musset’s poems.</p>

<p>On the fly-leaf there was a name written, a
name that was almost strange to Mr. Piper, though
his second wife had signed it in the marriage
register.</p>

<p>Isabel.</p>

<p>Isabel, written in a bold masculine hand, beneath
it a date, and two words in a language that Mr.
Piper knew not.</p>

<p>
<i>Zum Gedächtniss.</i><br />
</p>

<p>He tossed the book aside, as if it were some reptile
that had stung him, and went on with his investigation.
In front of the window there stood an old
Dutch escritoire, inlaid with many-coloured woods,
a thing of numerous drawers and recesses, and quaint
hiding-places, in which to keep secret store of money
or documents. It might have been the joy of some
Dutch housewife in days gone by, or the private
treasury of some rich burgher, in the fat and fertile
Low Countries, where life slides gently by in an
unostentatious prosperity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Piper had seen his wife write her letters at
this desk. The lid was closely shut, locked. This
exasperated him, though it was hardly a circumstance
to be wondered at that a lady should lock
her desk. In Mr. Piper’s present temper it seemed
an evidence of guilt. He tried to wrench open
the lid by means of its delicate brass handles, and
failing in this, he took out a strong knife which he
used for lopping an occasional withered branch in
his park or gardens, and prised the lock. Within
all things were neatly arranged. Packets of dainty
note-paper and envelopes, gold and ivory penholders,
mother-o’-pearl blotting-book, pigeon-holes filled
with letters.</p>

<p>Mr. Piper emptied the pigeon-holes, and ran
his eye rapidly over their contents. The letters
were all undeniably feminine. No, there was
nothing here from Captain Standish. But then these
old cabinets generally contain hidden receptacles for
guilty secrets, sly nests, in which to hatch state,
or domestic, treason.</p>

<p>Mr. Piper seized the sandalwood beading that
framed the pigeon-holes, with both his hands, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
drew them out bodily, in one piece, like a drawer.
Behind them appeared a row of neat little recesses,
each with its inlaid door.</p>

<p>‘This is where she would keep anything she
wanted to hide,’ thought Mr. Piper.</p>

<p>He was not mistaken. In one of the recesses
he found some money lying loose. A bank note
and half a dozen sovereigns. In another there
was a morocco jewel-case, containing an opal cross
set with diamonds, a trinket which Mr. Piper had
never seen till that moment. A third recess was
crammed with letters, this time unmistakably
masculine.</p>

<p>Bella’s husband sat down before the desk, and
read these letters one by one, carefully. His commercial
instincts came to his aid and kept him
wondrously cool. He arranged the letters according
to their dates, and after reading one, folded and
endorsed it neatly before he laid it aside, as if it had
been a business document. Had he been a lawyer
preparing a case for the divorce court he could
hardly have been more deliberate.</p>

<p>The first ten or twelve letters were innocent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
enough. Courteous little notes about archery—French
novels—a volume generally accompanying
the letter that recommended it. Then the tone grew
gradually more familiar—the notes became letters;
then came sentiment—as morbidly sweet as the correspondence
of Julie and her St. Preux, but happily
without Julie’s tendency to sermonizing. Then they
grew still warmer—the old, old story, abuse of the
stern laws that set up the accident of wedlock as a
barrier against the divinity of passion.</p>

<p>There was a great deal Mr. Piper could not
understand, but the gist of all was very clear to him.
He saw that to the bottom of her heart his wife
had been false, and that if she had hesitated on the
brink of criminal treason, it was because she loved
Little Yafford Park and the wealth that went along
with it, not because she had one spark of gratitude
or affection for him, Ebenezer Piper.</p>

<p>There was no limit to her treachery. The husband
saw himself ridiculed, travestied—in the
lover’s letters. His ignorance, his vulgarity, were
put forward as reasons why his wife should betray
him. Such a man—to put the insolent plea in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
plain words—was unworthy of pity; he was beyond
the pale of social law—the code of gentlemanly
honour did not recognise his existence. He was a
cipher, like those wretched husbands in the old
feudal days, from whom the lord of the soil might
take everything, bride, honour, the right of property
in a newly wedded wife, as in the land they tilled
and the harvest they reaped.</p>

<p>Mr. Piper made the letters up into a couple of
neat bundles, and put them in his pocket. There
was a letter for every day in the week. Captain
Standish’s idleness had run into letter-writing.
Then, pale to the lips, but cold and firm, Mr. Piper
replaced the pigeon-holes, shut the escritoire, and
went downstairs to see if his wife had yet come
home.</p>

<p>‘Home,’ he repeated. ‘No, she shall never call
my house by that name again.’</p>

<p>And then he remembered his first wife, with her
humble dog-like fidelity, her narrow spirit, troubled
about many things, but always true to him,
reverencing him as the king of men, the epitome
of wisdom. Poor Moggie, who had been pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
and buxom once, and who had kept his house so
well in those happy days when he was beginning
to grow rich. Ah, how different from this beautiful
viper, this living lie, a creature that could smile
at him and caress him while she kept those letters
in her desk!</p>

<p>‘She shall never cross my threshold again,’ he
said to himself. ‘There shall be no slander—no
legal separation. I’ll give her a thousand a year,
and she may go to the devil her own way.’</p>

<p>The clock struck five as he went downstairs. A
cold white mist veiled the park, and crept into the
house. The fire glowed redly on the hearth in the
hall, before which the footman sat in a Glastonbury
chair, reading the newspaper.</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Piper not returned yet?’ asked the master
of the house.</p>

<p>‘No, sir.’</p>

<p>The man vacated the seat in his master’s favour,
and went off to his tea and toast in the servants’
hall—such buttered toast as could never have been
in the first Mrs. Piper’s time, when there were
close calculations weekly as to the pounds of butter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
that had been consumed—‘made away with’ the
late Mrs. Piper called it when she was angry—during
the last seven days.</p>

<p>Mr. Piper sat before the fire, looking straight
into the glowing pile of coal and wood, and thinking
of the letters he had just read. His mind was so
full of these that the fact of his wife’s prolonged
absence troubled him not at all. It did not even
strike him as strange that she should be so long
away. That other wonder, the strangeness of her
treachery, the wonder that any woman could so
deceive, absorbed every thought. He sat before the
fire, meditating this great iniquity, and with only a
dreamy sense that the day had been long, and that
evening was drawing in.</p>

<p>So he sat, till he was startled by the sound of
wheels upon the gravel drive. He went to the door
and looked out through the glass panel. A carriage
was coming slowly up the drive, followed by a man
and woman on horseback, Captain Standish and Miss
Porkman. Then came a horse led by a couple of
men—a black horse, that walked lame, and hung
his head dejectedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span></p>

<p>Where was his wife among all these?</p>

<p>He opened the door and went out upon the broad
stone steps. The carriage came up at a foot pace. A
man got out—little Mr. Namby, the village surgeon.</p>

<p>He came up the steps to Mr. Piper. Captain
Standish dismounted and joined them.</p>

<p>Even in the autumn dusk Mr. Piper could see
that his foe was ashy pale, and moved by some
violent agitation. Standish tried to speak, but the
words would not come.</p>

<p>‘You tell him,’ he said to Mr. Namby, and then
turned his back upon them both, and leant against
one of the pillars of the portico, with his face hidden.</p>

<p>‘My dear Mr. Piper,’ began the surgeon, tremulously,
‘something dreadful has happened.’</p>

<p>‘I know it,’ answered Piper, curtly.</p>

<p>‘You have seen a great deal of domestic trouble—your
first wife’s long illness; but—I—I fear this
is worse than anything you have had to go through.’</p>

<p>‘It is,’ said Piper.</p>

<p>‘But how is this?’ asked the surgeon, with a
puzzled air. ‘Has any messenger come on to you?
Have you heard——?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span></p>

<p>‘Have I heard of what?’</p>

<p>‘The accident in the hunting-field, Mrs. Piper’s
fall?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, she has had a fall, has she?’ said Mr. Piper,
with a most extraordinary coolness.</p>

<p>Mr. Namby thought he had gone suddenly mad.</p>

<p>‘Yes, a very bad fall. I fear it may be fatal.
Will you send for her maid, or some one? We are
going to lift her out of the carriage. She is quite
helpless. She must be carried to her room.’</p>

<p>Vanessa Porkman had alighted from her horse,
and came up the steps to Mr. Piper.</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ she cried, ‘it is too dreadful—a judgment
upon us for going after the hounds without your
knowledge—or pa’s. It wasn’t I who proposed it—indeed
it wasn’t, dear Mr. Piper, but I feel myself
guilty for all that. Can you ever forgive me?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you’ve been hunting, have you, my wife and
you—foolish of her, for she was never on a horse till
I—I beg pardon—till Captain Standish gave her one,’—this
in tones loud enough for the ear of the Captain,
who stood close by.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Piper went down the steps and saw his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
wife lifted out of the carriage, and carried slowly and
carefully into the house. There were two doctors, Mr.
Namby, and Dr. Milroyd, from Great Yafford, who
had been in the field when Erebus balked himself at
a bullfinch, and rolled into the ditch with his rider
beneath him. Bella’s maid and the butler both
assisted. There was no lack of aid, but Mr. Piper
stood on the steps and saw the little lifeless figure in
the dark green habit carried past him, and offered no
help.</p>

<p>He was on the threshold of his door when he
turned and confronted Captain Standish. All the
rest had followed Bella. These two were face to
face with each other, and alone.</p>

<p>‘What do you want in my house?’ asked Mr.
Piper, sternly.</p>

<p>‘I should like to stop till—till the doctors have
made their examination—to know if things are so
bad as they seem to think,’ faltered the captain,
thoroughly crestfallen; and then, with a sudden burst
of passion, he cried, ‘Can’t you understand that I
feel myself to blame for this? It was I that put the
notion of hunting in her head. I feel myself her
murderer.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes, I understand perfectly,’ answered Mr.
Piper. ‘I’ve got your letters in my pocket—your
letters to my wife. Do you understand that,
scoundrel? First you perverted her mind, and then
you killed her. That’s enough, I should think.
You can want nothing more in my house; but when
you boast of having seduced my wife, tell your
friends that among all the husbands you have
injured, one, at least, left a lasting mark upon you.’</p>

<p>Mr. Piper seized the captain by the collar, and
with one crushing blow from his clenched fist sent
him rolling down the steps. Captain Standish was
an accomplished pugilist, but that unexpected blow
carried all the force of a strong man’s outraged
honour, and might have felled an ox. The tall slim
figure swayed to and fro, swerved to the left, and fell
face downwards against the base of a stone column.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">LET SILENCE BE ABOUT HER NAME.</span></p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Bella</span> was dying. The doctors had pronounced their
verdict. The spine had been fatally injured. A few
hours of life—hours in which there would be happily
little or no suffering—alone remained to Mr. Piper’s
second wife. Very brief had been the story of his
courtship and marriage.</p>

<p>He had sent off a groom to Great Yafford on one
of the carriage horses to summon the most famous
surgeon in the town, but Dr. Milroyd, who was a
physician of some standing, and the humble Mr.
Namby, who was not without experience in surgery,
assured Mr. Piper that the whole college of surgeons
would be powerless to prolong Bella’s life for an hour
beyond the natural running out of the sand in a
glass that had been turned for the last time.</p>

<p>‘You can go and sit by her if you like,’ said Mr.
Namby, kindly. ‘It can do no harm. She would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
like you to be there, I dare say, poor thing. And
don’t you think her family ought to be sent for?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered Mr. Piper. ‘I dare say she’d like
to see them.’</p>

<p>They were standing in the corridor outside
Bella’s room. That strange tranquillity of Mr.
Piper’s impressed the doctors. They ascribed it
to the intensity of his grief. He was stunned, no
doubt, poor fellow, by the sudden calamity.</p>

<p>Ebenezer Piper went into the apple-green bedroom
where his wife was lying, the wife who was so
soon to drift away from him down that dark stream
which led he knew not whither. The certainty of
impending death made her sacred. She was beyond
punishment or upbraiding. One could scarcely say
hard things to the vilest criminal, when his hour of
doom was fixed and the rope round his neck. The
final irrevocable sentence stultifies all lesser penalties.</p>

<p>Bella was lying with her face turned away from
the light, her lovely auburn hair rippling over the
pillows—that hair whose luxuriance had been one
of her charms. One little hand lay inert upon the
satin coverlet. How pretty she was! The sense of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
her beauty struck her husband with actual pain. So
lovely, so innocent-looking, and so false!</p>

<p>‘If she had lived I would have never seen her
face again,’ he thought, ‘but now it doesn’t matter.’</p>

<p>He sat down in the arm-chair by her bed, and
waited for her to speak. For himself there was
nothing that he could say to her. There was an
aching pity for her untimely fate in his heart, coexistent
with his burning indignation at her
treachery. The fact that she was speedily to die
might touch him with compassion, but it could not
lessen the baseness of her ingratitude or make her
falsehood pardonable.</p>

<p>She moved her head restlessly on the pillow, and
gave a sigh of weariness.</p>

<p>‘Who’s that?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘Your husband,’ Mr. Piper answered, quietly.</p>

<p>‘Can you forgive me for hunting without your
permission?’ she said in a low voice. How often had
that dulcet voice charmed her husband! ‘It was
very wrong, very foolish, but you see I have to pay a
big price for it.’</p>

<p>‘Is there nothing else you have to ask forgiveness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
for?’ he inquired, bitterly. ‘You had better make
a clean slate while you are about it. Is there
nothing else you are sorry for—on your deathbed?’</p>

<p>There was a pause. Almost unawares the husband
took one of those long silken tresses and
twined it round his fingers, the bright soft hair he
had loved so well.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps I have not been grateful enough for all
your kindness,’ faltered Bella. ‘You have been very
good to me—very generous. Yes, I ought to have
been more grateful.’</p>

<p>‘Do you really think so?’ asked Mr. Piper, with
keenest bitterness. ‘Can you really find a speck or
flaw in your conduct? Don’t you think you have
been a perfect wife?’</p>

<p>Bella began to cry.</p>

<p>‘I am sure I have tried to do my duty,’ she said.
‘I have tried to make your home pleasant to you—and
to improve your position in society.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered the husband, with an uncontrollable
gust of passion. ‘You have made me
acquainted with Captain Standish.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span></p>

<p>Bella’s quiet weeping changed to hysterical
sobbing. Her whole frame was shaken.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ pursued Mr. Piper. ‘You have tried
very hard to improve my position in society. You
have held me up to scorn and ridicule. You have
made me the laughing stock of my old friends, as the
fond deluded husband—the middle-aged dupe of a
pair of blue eyes and a rosebud mouth. While my
first wife lived I was a respectable man. You have
made me—what? A door-mat for Captain Standish.’</p>

<p>‘I have done nothing really wicked,’ pleaded
Bella. ‘I have been foolish, perhaps. I have let
him pay me compliments—and—and—that kind of
thing. But I have not broken one of the commandments.
I could kneel in church and hear them
read without feeling myself a castaway.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t cry,’ said Mr. Piper. ‘There’s no use in
talking about it. I have read Captain Standish’s
letters to you.’</p>

<p>‘You have broken open my desk,’ cried Bella, in
sudden alarm.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I have seen his presents, and read his
letters, and I can guess what he thought of you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
when he wrote them, and what he meant to be the
end of your acquaintance.’</p>

<p>‘He asked me to run away with him, and I
refused,’ protested Bella.</p>

<p>‘That was the first time,’ said Mr. Piper, coolly.
‘You refused me the first time, you know. The
captain meant to ask again, you may be sure.’</p>

<p>‘I have been selfish and ungrateful,’ sobbed
Bella.</p>

<p>‘God made you so, I think,’ answered Mr. Piper,
excusingly. ‘I believe it’s in the grain. Don’t cry,
poor thing. If you had lived there must have been
a bitter reckoning between you and me—but death
squares everything. If God can forgive you, I must
not stand out. He’s the largest creditor.’</p>

<p>He took the little cold hand lying loose upon
the coverlet, and pressed it gently. It was not in
his nature to be unmerciful. And then she was
passing away from him—she was drifting out of his
jurisdiction. There was that awe upon him which
the hardest must feel in the presence of death. At
that friendly pressure Bella gave a sob of relief.</p>

<p>‘Oh, if you can only forgive me, I think I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
die in peace,’ she said. ‘It seems hard to die—so
young—and just as life was so bright. But I have
been very wicked—to others as well as you. There
is some one to whom I must make atonement.
Send for Mr. Culverhouse.’</p>

<p>‘Wouldn’t you rather see Mr. Dulcimer?’ asked
Mr. Piper, thinking that the Vicar ought to be a
more powerful friend at this crisis.</p>

<p>‘No, no, Mr. Culverhouse. I cannot die in
peace till I have seen him.’</p>

<p>‘He shall be sent for this minute, Bella. Don’t
agitate yourself.’</p>

<p>Mr. Piper went out of the room and gave his
orders, and then came back and seated himself
quietly by the bed, and kept silence. It was not
quite two years since he had sat by poor Moggie’s
death-bed, and heard her talk of heaven, and how
they two were to meet there and know each other
again, and have all their children join them one by
one in due time, like an affectionate Irish family
whose elders had emigrated to America. To
Moggie’s simple soul death had seemed verily
emigration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span></p>

<p>It was night when Cyril Culverhouse answered
Mr. Piper’s summons. He had been for one of his
long rounds in outlying districts, and only came
home at ten o’clock, to hear of the calamity at the
Park. To Bella those hours of waiting had seemed
endless.</p>

<p>‘If I die without seeing him, I am a lost
creature,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘But, Bella, if there’s any weight upon your
conscience, can’t you trust your husband?’ asked
Mr. Piper. ‘Surely there’s no one with a better
right to know.’</p>

<p>‘It’s nothing that concerns you,’ answered
Bella, impatiently. ‘You have found out the worst
about me. This is a deeper wrong. This is something
wicked that I did when I was a girl. It
didn’t seem much to do, but it has weighed upon
me ever since.’</p>

<p>Mr. Piper wondered at this confession. He had
never seen any indication of a troubled conscience
in his wife’s manner or conduct.</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Culverhouse was announced. Mr.
Piper went out into the corridor to receive him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span></p>

<p>‘My wife is uneasy in her mind about something,’
he said. ‘I dare say she’d like to see you
alone. Don’t be hard upon her, Mr. Culverhouse,
if she has done anything wrong. She has only a
few hours to live. She has thrown her foolish
young life away to gratify the whim of the
moment.’</p>

<p>‘Hard upon her!’ exclaimed Cyril. ‘You need
not fear.’</p>

<p>Cyril went alone into the apple-green bedroom.
Mr. Piper walked up and down the corridor, waiting
for the interview to be over. He was passing Miss
Porkman’s door when Vanessa put her head out.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mr. Piper, mayn’t I go to her?’ she asked.
‘The doctors have told me that they can’t save her.
I feel so miserable. I feel as if it were my fault.’</p>

<p>‘It’s everybody’s fault,’ said Mr. Piper. ‘We’ve
all been fools. I indulged her like a fool, and she
made a foolish use of my indulgence. See what it
has led to—a life thrown away.’</p>

<p>‘It’s too dreadful,’ said Vanessa, who had never
before been face to face with the tragedy of
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span></p>

<p>‘How did it happen?’ asked Mr. Piper. ‘You
were with her, weren’t you?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I saw it all. She had set her heart upon
hunting, you know. And Captain Standish said
the horse was a splendid hunter—and so he seemed,
poor foolish thing, till he took that fatal jump.
We went to the meet, and then when the hounds
went off we followed them with the rest. It was
lovely, the thing I had been longing for ever since I
began to ride. For the first hour or so it was
the easiest thing in the world—riding a little, and
waiting about a good deal; and then they found the
fox, and there was a rush, and we started at a
splendid pace, Bella and I side by side, and Captain
Standish close to us. She rode beautifully, and the
horse behaved beautifully. The captain praised her
for her pluck. She jumped three or four low hedges—and
a ditch or two—and did it as easily as if she
had been hunting all her life—and then we came to
a stretch of open country, and the horses flew. We
were among the first all through, and Bella was in
raptures with her horse—and then—and then—the
rest seems like a dreadful dream—all dimness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
confusion—we came into a big ploughed field with a
bullfinch at the end. “There’s a gap,” cried somebody,
and I was just riding off with some of the
others towards a corner of the field, when Captain
Standish called to Bella very loud, “Don’t try it,”
and in the next minute I saw the black lift himself
up for the jump beautifully—and then his hind feet
caught in the top of the quickset hedge, and he
rolled over into the next field with Bella under
him. It was all done more quickly than I can
tell it.’</p>

<p>There was a long pause, and then Mr. Piper
gave a shuddering sigh.</p>

<p>‘Did you know she was following the hounds
without her husband’s knowledge or consent?’ he
asked.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid I did,’ answered Miss Porkman,
with a contrite air. ‘But I did not think any
harm would come of it. She rode so well, and
the horse was a clever hunter. Captain Standish
tried him two or three times. It was poor Bella’s
inexperience; she went straight at that tall thick
quickset hedge—an awful thing—like a wall.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span></p>

<p>‘I don’t think it will be a particularly pleasant
recollection for you to carry about with you
during the rest of your life, Miss Porkman,’ said
Mr. Piper.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mr. Piper, surely you can’t blame me,’
remonstrated Vanessa, tearfully.</p>

<p>‘I do blame you for aiding and abetting my
wife in disobedience,’ Mr. Piper answered, severely.</p>

<p>While this conversation was taking place in
the corridor, Cyril Culverhouse sat in Mr. Piper’s
chair by Bella’s pillow, and waited for the departing
sinner’s confession, ready with words of
comfort and exhortation.</p>

<p>‘I have been dreadfully wicked,’ she began,
falteringly, ‘but it was all Mrs. Dulcimer’s fault.’</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Dulcimer! How could Mrs. Dulcimer
cause you to do wrong?’</p>

<p>‘She put a foolish idea into my head, and it
took root there, and poisoned my life. She told
me that—I hate myself when I think how easily
I was duped—that you cared for me.’</p>

<p>‘Hush!’ said Cyril, gently. ‘Why talk of
that now? It was foolish of Mrs. Dulcimer. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
has made a good many mistakes of that kind—out
of kindness. But the error did not last long.
I told her frankly that my heart had been given
elsewhere—that you could never be more to me
than a friend whose amiability and sweetness I
admired. Why recall that? You have been
happily married to a good man. He deserves all
your pity in this dark hour—your affectionate
consideration. And you have to think of God.
You may have offended Him in many things.
Give the short hours He has left you to prayer
and meditation.’</p>

<p>‘I must recall that wretched mistake,’ said Bella,
feverishly. ‘I tell you it was that which made
me wicked. I have been very wicked. I have
injured my kindest friend.’</p>

<p>‘What friend?’ asked Cyril, very pale.</p>

<p>‘Beatrix Harefield!’</p>

<p>‘You have injured her?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. Do you see a jewel-case on the dressing-table
over there—a large morocco case? Take
my keys from under my pillow. I have no power
to move myself—but I made the doctor put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
my keys under my pillow. It is the smallest key
of all,’ she went on, when Cyril obeyed her.
‘Now open the jewel-case, and press the little
gilt knob at the right side of the tray. That
opens a drawer, doesn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, the drawer has come out. There is a
letter in it,’ said Cyril.</p>

<p>‘Take that letter. I found it on the table in
Mr. Harefield’s library the morning after his death.
It is addressed to his daughter.’</p>

<p>‘And you have kept it ever since? This letter—left
for his daughter to read after his death.
You are indeed a wicked woman.’</p>

<p>‘I did not think how wicked it was at the
time,’ faltered Bella. ‘But some devil prompted
me to take it, and hide it—till—till I should feel
inclined to give it up. And then—oh, why do
you make me tell you all my wickedness? I knew
that you loved her, and I thought—if—if people
believed her guilty of her father’s death, you would
not marry her. That awful suspicion would part
you. The letter might have put an end to the
suspicion, perhaps. I did not know what was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
the letter. I never broke the seal, you see. Yes,
I was steeped in wickedness when I did it. I
would have sold my soul to Satan to part you
and Beatrix. Do you think God will forgive me?’</p>

<p>‘God’s mercy is infinite, and forgives even
treachery,’ answered Cyril, coldly. He was standing
by the dressing-table, holding Christian Harefield’s
letter in his hand. ‘But it is a sin that
man finds it hard to forgive. What you did was
a vile and cruel act. I cannot palter with the
truth because your hours are numbered. That is
the reason why I should speak all the more plainly.
If I were a stranger to Beatrix Harefield, I should
look upon your conduct with horror—but I—I—who
loved and wronged her—wronged her by a
suspicion which this letter might have set at rest
for ever—how can I think of your conduct calmly?
How can you expect pardon or pity from me?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t expect either,’ whimpered Bella. ‘I’m
glad I am going to die. I have made a wretched
use of my life. I am almost glad it is over.
And yet it seems hard to die before one is five-and-twenty.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span></p>

<p>Her hand, straying idly in its feverish unrest,
entangled itself in a tress of auburn hair.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t it bright and long?’ she said, with a
bitter little laugh. ‘With most women beauty dies
first. They die piecemeal, a little bit at a time,
till there is no trace left of the girl people used to
admire. That must be dreadful. To look in the
glass some morning, and see the change all at once,
and cry, “Can this really be I?” I am glad I
have escaped that.’</p>

<p>Cyril stood with the letter in his hand, silent.</p>

<p>‘Why don’t you open that letter?’ asked Bella.
‘It will solve the mystery, no doubt.’</p>

<p>‘Whether it can or no, I shall not break the
seal,’ answered Cyril. ‘It shall be my business
to put this letter into Beatrix Harefield’s hand.’</p>

<p>‘And you will tell her how wicked I was, and
how I hated her from the moment I knew she had
stolen your love.’</p>

<p>‘Her excellence commanded my love. She did
not steal it. My heart never belonged to any other.’</p>

<p>‘Why do you quarrel with a poor dying creature
about words? To me it seemed that she stole your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
heart. She came between me and the only man I
ever loved. How could I help hating her?’</p>

<p>‘Why will you think and talk of these things?’
pleaded Cyril, going back to his seat by the bedside,
determined, if it were possible, to bring this frivolous
soul to the contemplation of eternity. She was so
soon to be adrift on the wide ocean, and yet lingered
so idly to trifle with the shells upon the shore.</p>

<p>‘Remember all your past life only as a dream
that you have dreamt, a vision darkened by sin and
folly. You were guilty of a great sin when you stole
that letter, for you must have known that you were
injuring a fellow-creature. You took the letter
deliberately, to that end. But the motives that
prompted you to that act are of little moment now.
Think of it only as a sin to be repented of, with deep
and heartfelt contrition.’</p>

<p>Then he spoke to her in his sacred character, and
would not again suffer her mind to wander back to
earthly things. He was with her, reading to her,
talking to her, praying with her, for a long time, and
he left her at last with a mind that was at peace
with God and man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span></p>

<p>‘You will see Beatrix,’ she said at the last.
‘Tell her that I was very fond of her—once. That
the old love comes back now that I am dying. Tell
her that it is sweet to me now to think of her being
reunited to you. Ask her to forgive me—if she can.’</p>

<p>Cyril promised to come again early the next
morning. She should have her husband and her
family gathered round her bed, in that last sad communion,
where the prayers of the living and the
dying mingle in a solemn farewell.</p>

<p>But when Cyril came next morning, shortly
after dawn, with Mr. and Mrs. Scratchell, and Bella’s
eldest brother and sister, they were met on the
threshold of the house by Mr. Piper, who told them
all was over. She had died very peacefully, in the
chilly hour just before daybreak, with her hand
clasped in his.</p>

<p>‘Poor little woman!’ sighed the tender-hearted
Piper. ‘She spoke to me so sweetly just at the last.’</p>

<p>And Mr. Piper forgave even the treachery of an
intrigue carried on before his face. Had his wife
lived, pardon would have seemed to him almost impossible;
but anger died in his heart as he stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
beside the fair marble figure, and looked at the
flower-like lips that could never speak falsehood
any more.</p>

<p>He made Captain Standish’s worthless letters
and valuable gifts into a parcel, and had it delivered
at that gentleman’s quarters. The servant who carried
it heard incidentally that the captain had had a
bad fall from his horse on the Great Yafford road on
the evening after Mrs. Piper’s fatal accident, and had
gone home to be nursed.</p>

<p>This report caused Mr. Piper to smile, for the
first time since his discovery of his wife’s falsehood.</p>

<p>‘I believe I’ve put a mark upon him that he
won’t get rid of very quickly, even with her ladyship’s
sick nursing,’ he said to himself.</p>

<p>This was true. The broken head which the
captain had got that evening in the portico left a
scar that was not likely to be cured, let him live as
long as he might. But for once in his life Captain
Standish felt himself constrained to take his punishment
quietly. He had no redress against the man
whose wife’s loyalty he had perverted, and whom his
folly had widowed.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">‘BUT PROVE ME WHAT IT IS I WOULD NOT DO.’</span></p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">From</span> the house of death Cyril went straight to the
Vicarage, to tell his Vicar all that had happened, and
to entreat for immediate freedom. He could not rest
a day until he had given Christian Harefield’s letter
into Beatrix’s hands.</p>

<p>Clement Dulcimer was all indulgence, his wife
all sympathy.</p>

<p>‘We shall miss you sorely, as we missed you
before,’ said the Vicar, ‘but we shall manage to get
on somehow, as we managed before, and you will
come back to us, will you not, when you have
accomplished your mission?’</p>

<p>‘Without fail I shall return, though it will not
be to remain long with you, dear friend. Now that
my health is restored I begin to long for a wider
field.’</p>

<p>Then go as soon as you like, and God be with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
you,’ said the Vicar, heartily. ‘But I’m afraid you
will have some trouble to find the runaway heiress.’</p>

<p>‘I will find her,’ said Cyril, ‘if I have to wander
over all the earth in search of her.’</p>

<p>‘And you will marry her, and she will be Lady
Culverhouse after all, for of course if you married
you would have to take up your title,’ said Mrs.
Dulcimer. ‘It may be weak-minded on my part,
but I should like Beatrix to have the title. I always
used to think of her as Lady Culverhouse. Poor
Kenrick!’</p>

<p>‘I will take her that letter, her father’s last letter—a
letter which I cannot doubt contains a statement
of his fatal intention—the indisputable proof of her
innocence. I will put that letter in her hand, and
then she shall deal with me as she likes. It must be
for her to decide my fate.’</p>

<p>‘Why not put an advertisement in the <i>Times</i>,’
suggested the Vicar, ‘a carefully worded advertisement,
telling her that a letter written by her father
on the night before his death has come to hand, and
begging her to come home, where it awaits her?’</p>

<p>‘If she is abroad she is not likely to see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
<i>Times</i>,’ answered Cyril. ‘Besides, I would not vulgarize
her family secrets by putting them in an advertisement,
however enigmatically worded. No, it
shall be my business to find her. It is a small thing
for me to do—a small sacrifice, even if I were to
spend seven years of my life upon the task—a small
atonement for the cruel wrong I have done her.’</p>

<p>‘If you think that, you may as well set out,’ said
the Vicar. ‘But I don’t believe your quest will take
seven years of your life. Our modern civilization
has set its heel on knightly enterprise. Now-a-days
a man could not be chivalrous if he tried ever so
hard. Railways, post-offices, electric telegraphs,
have made all things easy. Romance is dead. Yes,
Cyril, you must be content to be a common-place
lover. You remember what old Aubrey says, “The
divine arts of printing and gunpowder have frightened
away Robin Goodfellow and the fairies.”’</p>

<p>‘You had a letter from Beatrix after she left us,
Clement,’ said Mrs. Dulcimer. ‘That might be some
use.’</p>

<p>‘Not much, I fear,’ answered the Vicar. ‘She
wrote to me from Paris within a week of her leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
us, asking my forgiveness for all the trouble she had
caused me. My forgiveness, poor child! As if it
were not her own life she had to dispose of, and her
own soul to which she was responsible for her deeds.
It was a sad sweet letter, full of affection and good
feeling, but it told me very little of her plans for the
future, except that she meant to wander about the
Continent with Madame Leonard, and that in the
course of her travels she intended to visit Italy, the
scene of her mother’s youth and of her mother’s
death.’</p>

<p>‘That would be a natural desire,’ said Cyril.</p>

<p>‘I cannot conceive that there can be much difficulty
in finding her,’ continued the Vicar. ‘A young
woman of landed estate cannot hide herself under a
bushel. She has a banker to whom she must apply
when she wants funds for her travelling expenses.
He must know something of her whereabouts.’</p>

<p>‘Where does she bank?’ asked Cyril.</p>

<p>‘At Hodge and Turner’s, at Great Yafford, the
County Bank.’</p>

<p>‘I will go at once and see if there is anything to
be learned there.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span></p>

<p>Cyril walked to Great Yafford that afternoon,
saw the bank manager, and ascertained from him
that Miss Harefield had written to the bank, from
Paris, for six hundred pounds in circular notes,
almost immediately after she left Little Yafford.
She had drawn nothing since that time. The circular
notes had been obtained by Messrs. Hodge and
Turner, through their London agents, from the
Temple Bar branch of the Union Bank.</p>

<p>‘The circular notes would go back to the bank
that issued them, would they not?’ asked Cyril.</p>

<p>‘Naturally, but there is no rule as to the time of
their return. The local banker who cashed a note
might hold it over until he had other bills to
transmit. A considerable time might elapse before
the notes got back to the bank that issued them.’</p>

<p>‘I shall go to the Union and try to find out when
and where the notes were cashed. Miss Harefield
has been away more than six months. Some of the
notes, at least, must have come back to the bank.
Will you give me a letter of introduction to the
manager?’</p>

<p>Cyril had already explained that he had a document<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
of vital importance to convey to Miss Harefield,
that it was in her interest he sought her.</p>

<p>The letter was written, and Cyril started by the
midday train for London. He saw the manager of
the Temple Bar branch early next day, and from his
courtesy obtained the following information:—</p>

<p>Three notes had been cashed in Paris on the 21st
of April.</p>

<p>Five notes had been cashed in Florence during
the months of May and June.</p>

<p>A note had been cashed at Brest in August,
one at Rennes in the same month, two at St. Malo
in September. There was nothing later than this.</p>

<p>The notes bore the address as well as the signature
of the writer. On those last notes cashed at St.
Malo the address was,</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Hotel Chateaubriand,</span> <br />
<span class="smcap">St. Servans.</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>It was the beginning of November. Cyril was in
a position to trace Miss Harefield’s movements up to
the 29th of September. She might have remained
even longer at St. Malo. It was clearly there that
he must go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span></p>

<p>Happily for his impatience, which was extreme,
the St. Malo boat sailed that night from Southampton.
Within twenty-four hours after he left the Union
Bank, Cyril was in the broad windy street of St.
Servans.</p>

<p>The proprietress of the hotel perfectly remembered
Miss Harefield. They had many English
visitors, but this lady was so distinguished. She
was at once so amiable and so dignified. She and
her companion had always dined in their own <i>salon</i>.
They had never appeared at the <i>table d’hôte</i>. They
had engaged a carriage for their express use, and had
driven about to all the interesting places in the
neighbourhood. The landlady was obligingly communicative,
but when she was asked where Miss
Harefield went upon leaving St. Servans, her information
came to a stop. There was the visitors’
book, in which Miss Harefield and Madame Leonard
had written their names, but beyond their names
nothing.</p>

<p>‘But these ladies must surely have given instructions
for their letters being sent after them,’ said
Cyril.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span></p>

<p>‘But no, Monsieur. They received no letters
while they were here; they appeared to expect none.’</p>

<p>‘Did you never hear them talk of where they
meant to go?’</p>

<p>‘No, Monsieur, they were ladies of an extreme
reserve—silent even—all that there is of the most
gracious—but never communicative. They left St.
Malo by the railway—that is all I can tell you.
They did not leave by the English boat.’</p>

<p>Cyril was at a standstill. He seemed no nearer
Beatrix now, at St. Malo, than he had been at Little
Yafford. Six weeks ago she had been an inmate of
this hotel, but in six weeks she might have travelled
to the other end of Europe. She, who was as free as
the wind, would hardly care to dawdle about the quiet
old towns of Brittany.</p>

<p>‘Was Miss Harefield well—did she seem in good
spirits?’ he asked the landlady.</p>

<p>‘Alas, no! she had been suffering. She came to
St. Servans for the sea baths. She needed strength.
She had the air of one who had suffered much grief.
Madame Leonard was always bright and cheerful,
and devoted to the young lady; but the English miss
was not happy. That showed itself to the eye.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span></p>

<p>‘Had she any medical attendant while she was
with you?’</p>

<p>‘No. She mocked herself of doctors.’</p>

<p>Cyril thanked the kindly proprietress, and strolled
idly away from the hotel. He knew not which direction
to take. The prospect was discouraging. Perhaps,
after all, he would be compelled to put an
advertisement in the <i>Times</i>, informing Beatrix, in
veiled words, that a letter of her father’s awaited
her at a certain address. But even if he did this,
how could he be sure she would see the paper?
He knew of old how difficult it is to find an English
newspaper in a French provincial town. No, he
must find her himself; but to his impatience the
thing seemed hopeless at the outset. He walked
through the well-remembered streets, by the ever-improving
fortifications, white stone walls looking
out upon a bright blue sea. The yellow sands by
the Grand Bé were deserted by their holiday crowd.
The cold autumn winds swept over the long low
shores. Everything had a desolate look.</p>

<p>Cyril went into St. Malo to see the churches,
which he remembered years ago. He spent a couple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
of hours looking at painted windows and sculptured
tombs. And then he wasted another hour strolling
about the streets and the quay, watching the boat
being loaded, and wondering what he should do
next. And then he went to the railway station to
find out all about the trains, with a vague hope
that some idea might suggest itself as to Beatrix’s
journey when she left St. Malo. He was on his way
to the station when a face flashed upon him in one
of the narrow streets, and passed him by before he
had time to remember where he had seen it.</p>

<p>Whose face could it be, and why was it so
familiar?</p>

<p>He stopped to consider, and looked back to see if
the owner of the face was still in sight. Yes, there
she was, walking briskly along the narrow pavement,
threading her way dexterously through the
crowd, a little woman, neatly dressed in a black
silk gown and a gray mantle.</p>

<p>Dimly, as in a dream, did he remember that face.
It must have been a memory of long ago, he thought.
And then in a moment he recalled the scene to
which that face belonged—his sick room at Bridford—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
old-fashioned wainscoted bedroom, with its
dull brown walls, four-post bedstead and drab hangings—the
weariness of fever and delirium—the bright
black eyes peering at him from the shadow of the
nun’s white hood.</p>

<p>‘It is my little nurse,’ he said to himself, ‘the
elder of those two good women.’</p>

<p>He turned and followed the lady in the gray
mantle. It was strange to see her in a dress so different
from her nun-like habit, but then she had told
him that she belonged to no conventual order.
Once having given her the start, it was not easy to
gain upon her, she tripped along so briskly, and the
street here close to the market was crowded. Cyril
was almost breathless when he caught her.</p>

<p>‘Pray, Madame, do not deny yourself to one who
is deeply indebted to you,’ he said, hat in hand,
gasping a little. ‘When you passed me just now
I recognised you as one I well remembered, but I
could not for the moment recall the circumstances of
our acquaintance. I have so longed to see you again,
to be able to thank you.’</p>

<p>The little Frenchwoman looked at him with a
most innocent stare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span></p>

<p>‘Monsieur deceives himself,’ she said in her own
language. ‘I have not the honour of his acquaintance.’</p>

<p>‘Nay, Madame, you cannot forget one who owes
you so much—perhaps life itself. You cannot have
forgotten your fever patient at Bridford.’</p>

<p>‘Bridford,’ echoed the lady, ‘what is that?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Madame, you are trifling with me. It is
not possible I can be mistaken. Do you not belong
to a nursing sisterhood, a band of holy women, who,
bound by no religious order, go about doing good,
attending their ailing fellow-creatures, without fee
or reward?’</p>

<p>‘No, sir, I do not. I never even heard of such
a sisterhood,’ replied the lady, resolutely.</p>

<p>‘I must ask you to pardon me, then. But it is
a most wonderful likeness. I am deeply disappointed,’
said Cyril, allowing the lady to pass, with
a respectful bow.</p>

<p>He was more than disappointed, he was mystified.
In spite of the lady’s assertion he could not bring
himself to believe that hers was not the face which
he had seen by his sick bed in those long hours of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
languor and prostration, when he had nothing to do
but watch his nurse’s kindly countenance, and listen
to her friendly talk.</p>

<p>Yet, if this was his nurse, why should she deny
herself to him? Was that one of the rules of her
order? Was the order a kind of masonic association
in good works?—a secret band of holy women,
who disavowed their benevolent deeds after they
were done?</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">FAIR STILL, BUT FAIR FOR NO ONE SAVING ME.</span></p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Cyril</span> would have liked to follow the mysterious
lady, but that would have been too discourteous;
so he wandered listlessly in the streets of St. Malo
for another hour or so, not knowing what to do
with himself, and finally came to a standstill at
an office on the outskirts of the town, whence a
diligence started every afternoon for Dol.</p>

<p>‘Dol,’ he said. ‘What is Dol? I was never
at Dol. I wonder if there is anything worth seeing
at Dol, and if it be possible that Beatrix can have
gone there?’</p>

<p>While he was wondering a hired fly drove up,
containing the lady in the gray mantle, and a number
of parcels of different kinds and sizes. The
driver of the diligence went forward to receive the
lady and her parcels. She was evidently a frequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
patron of his conveyance. He took pains to instal
her carefully in the wretched interior.</p>

<p>‘I’ll go to Dol,’ decided Cyril. ‘I am bent on
finding out who and what this woman is. It will
be only the loss of a day, and I shall have time to
think out my plan for finding Beatrix.’</p>

<p>It was foolish, perhaps, he thought afterwards,
to be so easily diverted from his path; but then
the fact was that he had no path to take—he was
fairly at a standstill. He could do no good by
perambulating the streets of St. Malo. Dol was a
place to explore—the chances against finding
Beatrix there were as ninety-nine in a hundred
perhaps—but it would be one town checked off the
map of Europe, and he might be able to find out
something about his mysterious sick nurse. So
Cyril mounted to the seat beside the driver, where
he had the shelter of an ancient leather hood to
protect him from the wind, and where he felt very
easy in his mind about the lady in the gray mantle.
She could not escape him on the road.</p>

<p>He questioned the driver about his passenger,
but the man could tell him nothing except that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
lady lived at Dol, and that she came into St. Malo
once a week to make her purchases. He could not
say how long she had lived there, as he had been
only driving the diligence for a month.</p>

<p>They drove through lanes and past fields and
orchards which were entirely Devonian in their
aspect, halted at a village which was quainter and
more picturesque, and, sooth to say, a little dirtier
than a Devonshire village, and finally arrived, as
the shades of evening were falling, at Dol, which
impressed Cyril at first sight as the dullest town
he had ever beheld. He knew Sandwich in Kent,
he had visited Stamford in Lincolnshire, he had
even seen Southend out of the Cockney season, but
Dol had a more utterly deserted look than any of
these. There were some fine mediæval buildings,
there was a grand cathedral with two towers, one
of which had been left unfinished in the Middle
Ages. There were interesting courts and crannies
and corners—but Melancholy had claimed Dol for
her own. The country round looked flat and depressing—the
outskirts of the town were arid and
dusty—the modern houses had that intensely new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
and unfinished aspect peculiar to French architecture;
and all ambitious attempts at improvement looked
as if they had been nipped in the bud.</p>

<p>There was one rather pretty-looking house, in
a small walled garden, and before the door of this
garden the diligence stopped, and the lady in the
gray mantle alighted. A French maid-servant
opened the gate and ran out to take the traveller’s
parcels, and then mistress and maid went in at the
door, and the walled garden swallowed them up.</p>

<p>The diligence deposited Cyril at an old inn in
a small square not far from the cathedral, a good
old house enough, where all things were cleanly
and comfortable, and where he found a good-natured
landlady, who was quite ready to answer his questions
while he waited for the <i>table d’hôte</i> dinner.</p>

<p>He described the white house in the walled
garden just outside the town, and asked if she could
tell him anything about its inmates.</p>

<p>It was a house which let itself garnished, she
told him, the owner being a merchant at Rennes,
who only came to Dol occasionally, because it was
his birthplace. Of its present inmates Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
knew nothing. She did not even know that it was
let. It had been long unoccupied. She excused
herself for this ignorance on the ground that she
went out so seldom. The house, and then the
kitchen occupied all her time, not to speak of her
two little angels, who were exacting, like all
children.</p>

<p>Of the two little angels, one was then squalling
lustily in the adjoining kitchen, while the other
hung to its mother’s gown and scowled at the
stranger.</p>

<p>‘Have you had many English visitors this
season?’ Cyril inquired.</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, Monsieur, a crowd. The English love
so much our Brittany—and Dol is the first town in
Brittany. It is interesting to the traveller were it
only for that reason.’</p>

<p>‘Naturally. Since September now—the end of
September—can you recall any English visitors,
ladies, who have been with you?’</p>

<p>‘But no, Monsieur. After September our season
is over. It is late. We have had no English ladies
since then.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span></p>

<p>‘There are other hotels at Dol, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Monsieur, but this is the first.’</p>

<p>Cyril dined with a few sleepy-looking inhabitants,
and a couple of sub-lieutenants from the
neighbouring barracks, and after his dinner went
to look at the cathedral, which had a shadowy
grandeur by the light of a few solitary lamps burning
here and there before a shrine.</p>

<p>After this he was glad to go to bed, having
slept very little on board the St. Malo steamer.
He put Christian Harefield’s letter under his pillow.</p>

<p>He was up before daybreak next morning, and
was out with the first streak of pallid light in the
east. He went first to look at the house which
had swallowed up the lady in the gray mantle.
He made a circuit of the garden-wall, but discovered
nothing except that there were poultry
on the premises, a fact imparted to him shrilly
by a peculiarly energetic cock, apparently of the
bantam breed, so eager was he, like all small creatures,
to assert his importance. There was no indication
of the life within to be drawn from the
blank white wall, the closed venetians of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
upper windows, or the gilded vane upon the roof.
Neighbours there were none. So he left the spot
no wiser than when he had approached it.</p>

<p>The morning was lovely, the air balmy, despite
the lateness of the season. It was just that calm,
delightful hour when earth seems as fresh as if
the Creator’s work were but newly finished. Cyril
set out on a perambulation of the neighbourhood
of Dol. His hostess had talked to him last night
of a certain Mont Dol, as a thing to be seen, so
he went to see what this Mont Dol was like.</p>

<p>He walked for about a couple of miles through
a level country, somewhat Flemish in its character,
a country that had only the charm of rusticity to
recommend it. Then he came all at once upon a
raw-looking church, of a commonplace order, a
few straggling cottages, and a steep rugged-looking
hill, which rose out of the level plain with an extraordinary
suddenness. He climbed this hill by
a rough road, which dwindled by and by into a
narrow winding track, and mounted in the early
sunlight to an undulating heathy hill-top looking
wide over the blue waters of the Channel. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
this hill-top there was no human habitation, only
a votive chapel and the white statue of a saint,
looking down upon the quiet hillocks and hollows,
the clumps of furze, and tranquil sheep cropping
the dewy grass in the sweet morning air. He had
never looked on a more pleasant scene. The world,
life, and all its cares lay far below him—the blue
wood smoke was curling up from the chimneys of
many-gabled Dol, the church tower and its
stunted twin brother, the tower that had never
been finished, rose darkly above all meaner things
on the level plain, white sails of passing vessels
were shining yonder against the blue horizon. He
felt himself alone upon this lonely hill, in a serener
atmosphere than the air of every-day life. A saintly
hermit of old time might have passed his contemplative
days pleasantly enough in a cell adjoining
the chapel yonder.</p>

<p>He rambled round the hill-top, lingering every
now and then to look landward or seaward, for
on either side the prospect was full of beauty.
It was a spot where any man, with a genuine
love of nature, might feel that he could spend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
hours and days of life, alone with his own thoughts
and the peaceful beauty round him. The big bell
of Dol chimed nine, the bright autumn sun climbed
higher in the blue clear sky, a sheep-bell tinkled,
an elderly lamb bleated, a little shepherd boy sang
his little nasal song, a late bumble-bee buzzed
among late furze bloom. There were no other
sounds.</p>

<p>Cyril made the circuit of the chapel, which
was closely locked against intrusion. He looked
at the statue, and turned his face idly seaward
for the twentieth time, thinking within himself
how foolishly he was wasting his day, and how
little this perambulation of the Mont Dol would
help him towards the accomplishment of his mission;
and as he was thinking thus, and as he
turned from the statue to the sea, he found himself
face to face with something sweeter than the
glad blue sea, dearer than all the wide bright
earth, the face of the woman he loved.</p>

<p>She was standing before him, looking at him
with a grave sad smile, dressed in black, and thin
and careworn, beautiful only for eyes that loved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
her, since she had wasted the freshness of her
youth and beauty in tears and sleepless nights,
and untimely cares.</p>

<p>‘Beatrix!’ he cried, with a rush of gladness
that almost stifled him. ‘Beatrix, Providence has
sent us to meet here. I had sworn to myself to
travel all over the world in search of you.’</p>

<p>‘Why should you want to find me?’ she asked.
‘I thought there were no two persons on this
earth with less reason to wish to meet than you
and I.’</p>

<p>‘I should not have presumed to follow you if
I had not a motive strong enough to excuse my
audacity. I have brought you this.’</p>

<p>He took Christian Harefield’s last letter from his
pocket, and gave it her without a word of explanation.</p>

<p>‘From my father!’ she cried, looking at the
address, and then tearing open the envelope with
trembling hands. ‘In heaven’s name how did you
come by this letter—from my dead father? You
who suspected me——’</p>

<p>Tears choked her. She brushed the hot drops
from her eyes, and began to read the letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span></p>

<p>‘“Sunday night, December 23rd,”’ she began,
falteringly.</p>

<p>‘Why, that was the night before his death,’
she cried. ‘Read it for me. I cannot see the
words. They swim before my eyes.’</p>

<p>Cyril stood by her side, reading the letter
across her shoulder. He put his arm round her
to hold her up, and she leaned against him
trembling, hardly able to stand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘<span class="smcap">My Poor Child</span>,—When you open this letter
you will be fatherless—a little loss, for I have never
been a father to you in anything save the name.
For the last ten years I have been a miserable man,
too miserable to care for my own flesh and blood,
all that was good in me turned to evil.</p>

<p>‘I loved your mother as women are not often
loved, with an intense and concentrated affection
that goes hand in hand with intense jealousy. I
do not think it is possible for a man to love as
I loved, and endure the knowledge that his love
was unrequited, without having his nature perverted.
My unrequited love engendered suspicion, evil
thoughts, hatred of myself and the thing I loved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span></p>

<p>‘By a series of fatalities, which I need not set
forth here, I was led to believe your mother false
and unworthy—a degraded woman—a disgrace to
you as she was a dishonour to me. To-night I
learn that she was innocent—that her only sin
against me was a sin of my own creation. She
might have loved me, as the years went on, had I
shown myself worthy of her love by trusting her
truth and honour. My jealousy made her life
miserable, and my groundless suspicion drove her
from me, to die alone, friendless, hidden in an
Italian convent.</p>

<p>‘Knowing what I know, knowing how happiness—the
purest and deepest—was within my reach,
and that I let it go, knowing that the bitterest
miseries of my life were engendered in my own
perverted mind, knowing that I made the misery
of the being I fondly loved—I feel that I can no
longer support the burden of a life without hope.
Every chain must wear out in time. Mine was worn
to attenuation before to-night—this last blow snaps
it. To-morrow, when the world wakes to its petty
round of cares and joys, my troubles will be over.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
You will find me as calm as if my life had been all
peace. Saint and sinner are equal in death.</p>

<p>‘God bless you, poor child. May He be kinder
to you than your earthly father has been. Love I
could not give you—but the wealth which is mine to
bestow I give you freely. Take warning from my
miserable fate, and do not marry without the
certainty that you are beloved. Your fortune will
mark you out as a prey for every adventurer.</p>

<p>‘Should there be an inquiry about my death you
can show this letter to the coroner. Should things
pass, as, for your sake, I hope they may, without
comment, let these last words of mine be sacred, the
one only confidence I have ever given to my only child.</p>

<p>‘Enclosed you will find a statement from the
principal of the convent where your ill-used mother
spent her last days. It may please you some day
to visit her grave in that lonely spot, and to weep
there for the injuries my love inflicted on her, as I
have wept for her this night, tears of blood, wrung
from a heart tortured by vain remorse.</p>

<p class="center">
‘Your erring, unhappy father,<br />
‘<span class="smcap">Christian Harefield</span>.’
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span></p>

<p>‘Do you believe now that I did not murder my
father?’ cried Beatrix, turning to Cyril, with eyes
that flashed indignant scorn through her tears.</p>

<p>‘I never believed otherwise, after we met face to
face in the churchyard. I needed but to see you to
know that you were innocent, and pure, and true.
My suspicion was a monster of my own growth—the
offspring of too much thought—and the fear that in
winning your love I should seem a worshipper of
mammon. Beatrix, I have been weak and despicable
in this matter. My love should have been
strong enough to withstand even a harder trial. I
confess myself unworthy of your forgiveness, and
yet I ask you to forgive me.’</p>

<p>‘Forgive you!’ she said, that changeful face of
hers melting from scorn to tenderness. ‘There is no
moment of the past in which you were not forgiven.
I was too ready to make excuses for you. I had no
womanly pride, where you were concerned. It was
only when I was made to believe that you had
never cared for me—that from the first you had
liked Bella Scratchell better than me—it was only
then that I was weak enough to listen to Kenrick’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
pleading. I thought it mattered so little what
became of me, that I might as well give way. And
then, when the time for our marriage drew near, I
knew that I was going to commit a great sin, and
I began to look for some way of escape. I only
waited to arrange the release of Kenrick’s estate.
I had made up my mind to run away before I saw
you in the churchyard. You might have spared me
some of your bitter speeches.’</p>

<p>‘Forgive me, beloved, forgive me.’</p>

<p>His arm was round her, her head lying on his
breast, his lips bent down to hers, unreproved.
There was no need of many words between them.
Both knew that this chance meeting on the hill-top
above the brightening sea meant eternal reunion.
Who should part them now—these twin souls that
had been parted and buffeted by the billows of fate,
and had drifted together again at last? They clung
to each other in a silent rapture, knowing that their
hour of happiness had come.</p>

<p>‘I have never been angry with you,’ she faltered
at last. ‘Fate has seemed unkind, not you. I have
always believed you good, and true, and noble—even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
when you renounced me. Even when I
thought that you had cared for Bella——’</p>

<p>‘Who could have told you that utter falsehood?’</p>

<p>‘It was Bella herself who hinted——’</p>

<p>‘Poor child, don’t you know that people who
hint things they dare not assert are always liars?
But Bella is gone, with all her sins upon her head.
I will tell you more of her by and by. It is by her
act that you have suffered. It was she who stole
your father’s letter. On her death-bed——but
I will tell you all by and by. You have had too
much agitation already. How pale you are looking!
And you are shivering too. We have been standing
too long in this keen air. Let me take you home,
dearest. Do you live far from here?’</p>

<p>‘A good way, but I shall be better presently.’</p>

<p>‘Lean on my arm, love.’</p>

<p>And so supported, Beatrix walked slowly down
the narrow track, to the village at the foot of the
hill, and by and by a faint colour came back to her
cheeks, and a happy light shone in her lovely eyes.
The clock struck ten as they passed the church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span></p>

<p>‘I came out only for a ramble before breakfast,’
said Beatrix. ‘Poor Madame Leonard will be wondering
what has become of me.’</p>

<p>‘Madame Leonard? Ah, that is your companion.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, the dearest creature in the world. I could
never tell you what a comfort she has been to me—indulging
all my caprices—consoling me in my
sorrows—a second mother. And now she and I
will go together to see my own mother’s grave—the
convent where she died. I have been already to
see the place of her birth.’</p>

<p>‘My Beatrix, do you think I will ever let you
take any journey again without my company? A
man who has lost a jewel and found it again knows
how to guard his treasure. You are mine henceforward—mine
till death—unless you tell me I
have forfeited your love.’</p>

<p>‘I could not say anything so false. I have
never left off loving you,’ she answered gently.
‘Do not let us talk of the past. Let us forget
it, if we can. When I saw the announcement of
poor Kenrick’s death in the <i>Times</i> I felt myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
free—and—I thought—perhaps—some day I should
go back to Yorkshire to see the kind Dulcimers,
and my good old servants—and then—you and I
might meet. But I never thought it would be so
soon.’</p>

<p>‘God has been good to us, love. And now tell
me, Beatrix, can you bear to give up your
liberty and share the lot of a hard-working parish
priest? Could you bear even to go with me into
a busy, smoky town, full of foulest things—if I
felt that duty constrained me to take up my abode
there? Could you endure to live in such a place
as Bridford, for instance? But, I forget, you do
not know Bridford.’</p>

<p>‘I could endure life even at Bridford with you.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, but you have never seen the place, love.’</p>

<p>‘I repeat that I could share your life and labours
even at Bridford,’ she said, smiling at him.</p>

<p>He gave a little sigh.</p>

<p>‘I am afraid you hardly know what you are promising.
Know then, dearest, that I am in treaty
with the Vicar of Bridford, with a view to getting his
living transferred to me. It is a charge for which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
is eminently unfitted. I began some good work there,
and left it unfinished. As vicar I could do much
that I vainly attempted as curate. I should have
larger scope, better opportunities. I could get a
band of hard-working young men round me. Yes,
I believe I could transform the place.’</p>

<p>‘I am like Ruth,’ said Beatrix, tenderly. ‘I
follow where I love. Your duties shall be my duties,
and your home my home. It shall go hard with me
if I cannot make home pleasant to you, even at Bridford.’</p>

<p>‘And you will be content to see your wealth
applied to doing good among a rough and often
ungrateful population?’</p>

<p>‘I can imagine no better use for my wealth.’</p>

<p>‘Would you not rather that we should live at
Culverhouse, in that fine old house, in the midst of
that beautiful country? Poor Kenrick’s death has
made Culverhouse mine, you know.’</p>

<p>‘I had rather live where your life can be most
useful—noblest—and where I can help you.’</p>

<p>‘My own dear love, you make me happier than
words can say!’</p>

<p>They came to the sleepy old town of Dol, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
beyond it to a house half hidden behind a high white
wall. Beatrix opened a green door leading into a
garden, and Cyril followed her, full of wonder, into
the very garden which had swallowed up the lady in
the gray mantle.</p>

<p>That very lady came out, through an open window,
to receive Beatrix.</p>

<p>‘My love, how you have given me a beautiful
fright!’ she cried, in French; and then, seeing Cyril,
stopped and looked confused.</p>

<p>‘Madame Leonard, let me present Mr. Culverhouse.
He will stop to breakfast with us, I dare say,
if you ask him.’</p>

<p>‘I begin to understand something,’ said Cyril,
looking at Beatrix. ‘Madame Leonard was one of
my nurses, though she denied it yesterday.’</p>

<p>‘Pardon!’ exclaimed Madame Leonard. ‘I said
that I did not belong to a nursing sisterhood. I did
not say that I had not nursed you.’</p>

<p>And then the little Frenchwoman gave a joyous
laugh, out of pure satisfaction at the new aspect of
things, and ran back to the house to order certain
savoury additions to the breakfast, in honour of the
unexpected guest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span></p>

<p>‘Madame Leonard was one of my nurses,’ repeated
Cyril. ‘And you were the other. Oh,
Beatrix! how could I be so blind?’</p>

<p>‘Dear love, you were in the dark valley of death,’
said Beatrix. ‘It was my sweetest privilege to watch
and succour you. I owed all to Madame Leonard.
When I read of your dangerous illness in the Bridford
paper I was wretched at the thought of your
loneliness, your helplessness, and I longed to come to
you. Then this dear Madame Leonard suggested
that we should come, in the disguise of nursing
sisters, and take care of you. I should never have
dared such a thing without her help. She arranged
all—managed everything—smoothed away every
difficulty. I can never be grateful enough to her for
her goodness in that sorrowful time.’</p>

<p>‘And to think that I should never have guessed!
When you went from me I yearned for you, not
knowing why. Your shadowy eyes haunted me,
your image stayed with me like the memory of a
dream. Oh, my dearest, my truest, how can I love
you well enough for such love as this?’</p>

<p>They stayed in the wintry garden, talking of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
past and the future, till poor Madame Leonard began
to be unhappy about her carefully arranged breakfast.
And then, after she had summoned them three times,
they went in and sat at the snug round table drinking
coffee, and making believe to eat, and arranging
what was to be done next.</p>

<p>They were all to go back to Little Yafford together.
Cyril and Beatrix were to be quietly married
in the old village church, as soon as the Bridford
living was his. The Water House was to be kept up
in all its old comfort, and Madame Leonard was to
be mistress there. It would serve as a country
retreat for the Vicar of Bridford and his wife.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EPILOGUE">EPILOGUE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ten</span> years later, and Sir Cyril Culverhouse and his
wife are still at Bridford, in the good old Queen Anne
parsonage, not five minutes’ walk from the lodging
where the two nursing sisters came to tend the fever-stricken
curate. It is a fine old house, with red brick
walls, deep-set windows, oak wainscots, broad staircase,
and spacious hall paved with black and white
marble, a house which, in the eyes of previous vicars,
had been some compensation for the general smokiness
and unpleasantness of the town. There is a
good old garden too, at the back, which one would
hardly expect to find in Bridford—a garden where the
apple trees flourish, and the roses struggle into bloom
somehow, in spite of the smoke, and where the young
Culverhouses learn their lessons in summer, under
the direction of Madame Leonard, whom they adore.</p>

<p>Every July there is a migration to the Water
House, much to the delight of Mrs. Dulcimer, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
spoils Beatrix’s children, and believes religiously that
she brought about the match between Cyril and
Beatrix.</p>

<p>‘Did I not advise you to go to France after her,
Cyril?’ demands the old lady, triumphantly, ‘and did
I not set my heart upon her being Lady Culverhouse?’</p>

<p>Within the ten years that are gone Cyril has done
a great work in Bridford. That town is no longer a
hotbed for the generation of vice, drunkenness, and
fever. Sanitary reform, being a thing within the
scope of human handiwork, has been done by line
and rule, while other reforms, more subtle and secret,
have been going on quietly, side by side with improvements
in drainage and ventilation, water service
and cottage building. Large resources have enabled
Cyril to do what many a parish priest yearns in vain
to accomplish. He has built streets of cottages, a
club-house, half a dozen reading-rooms, a cottage
hospital ten miles from the town, infant nurseries in
every district. Instead of the one hard-worked
curate, employed by his predecessor, he has four
energetic young fellows going about all day long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
among the labouring poor, so that there is no corner
of the crowded town in which the influence of the
church is not daily felt, a protection against wrong,
a succour in calamity, an incentive to cleanly living.</p>

<p>Once in every year, when the spring flowers
are bright in the hedgerows, and the oaks are
yellow with their unfolded leaves, Sir Cyril and
his wife go with their children to Culverhouse
Castle. This is the happiest time of all the year
for Beatrix and her children, the holiday of holidays.
They know the country round Culverhouse
by heart. They ride in the forest, and sail on
the bright river, and make yachting excursions to
the Wight, and go back to stony-hearted Bridford
refreshed and strengthened by these simple natural
pleasures. At Culverhouse, Beatrix is adored, as
poor Kenrick prophesied she would be—but she
is not more honoured or beloved there than by
the rough factory hands of Bridford, where her
name is a synonym for goodness.</p>

<p>Mr. Piper lives his life at Little Yafford Park,
and spends unheard-of sums on the improvement
of his farm buildings and hothouses. He has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
not married again, but has made for himself an
idol in the shape of his farm. He goes on fattening
cattle, and sacrificing generation after generation
of pigs, in spite of the denunciations of
Mr. Chumney, who continues to protest that so
long as prize cattle are martyred at the shrine of
human vanity the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals is a mockery. Poor Mr. Piper
finds a consolation for past sorrows in the fatness
of his oxen and his pigs. His sons and daughters
have grown up. The sons are in different commercial
houses, learning to be merchant princes; the
daughters are established at the Park, in the rooms
which Bella beautified. The chief result of an
expensive education at present to be perceived in
these young ladies is a self-sufficiency which makes
them despise their father, whom they publicly reprove
for his faulty modes of speech, and his
many deviations from the strict laws of etiquette
as laid down by the Misses Turk. He is proud of
his two tall, over-dressed girls, nevertheless, though
not so proud of them as of his pigs, and he endures
their youthful insolence with unvarying good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
temper. As the years go on he gets stouter and
more puffy, eats more, drinks more, sleeps more,
and more markedly assimilates the manners and
customs of his prize porkers; whereat Chumney
shakes his head dolefully, and prognosticates that
Piper will go off some day like the snuff of a
candle.</p>

<p>The school at Little Yafford has thriven under
Emmanuel Joyce’s care, and the widow and her
son still live happily in the cottage adjoining the
school-house. Emmanuel is not solely dependent
on his modest stipend as parish schoolmaster. He
has been successful in his literary efforts. His
books, all written for the young, have become
immediately popular. His style is natural and
pleasing, full of life and colour. That severe self-training
he underwent in the days when he fancied
himself a poet has stood him in good stead. His
reading has taken a wider range, under the direction
of Clement Dulcimer, and there is a richness
of illustration in his later books that has a charm
even for the unlearned. Mrs. Joyce’s pride in her
son is boundless. She would like to see him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
married, but has not yet discovered that paragon of
female excellence worthy to be his wife. While
she is looking out for that personification of all
the virtues, Emmanuel grows more and more
wedded to his books, his chimney corner, his
meerschaum pipe, and the duties of that station
which Providence has allotted to him.</p>

<p>Miss Coyle has departed this life, in the odour
of sanctity, and her memory lives in the minds of
Yafford people as a highly genteel person, who
paid ready money for all her small requirements,
was strict in her attendance at the services of her
church, never carried a parcel, and was never seen
out of doors without her gloves.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
